This we do know at this hour /.|||O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O

He was in the military apparently a World War Two airman /.|||O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O
And while it looks like his plane crashed in the mountains so did twenty - five other planes around the same time /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Thelma Gutierrez went inside the forensic laboratory where scientists are trying to solve this mystery /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The search for clues takes us to Honolulu Hawaii to the joint powmia accounting command or jpac /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE B-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O
The mystery of the frozen airman is just one of more than a thousand different unsolved cases that scientists here at jpac are trying to solve /.|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O
In this laboratory alone I 'm surrounded by the remains of at least twenty different service members who are in the process of being identified so that they too can go home /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The investigation begins with a team of forensic specialists who probe and study the airman 's bones teeth and his belongings to piece together who he is /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And almost immediately clues begin to surface /.|||O O O O O O O O
Dr. Robert Mann a forensic anthropologist has determined that the airman was Caucasian and had fair hair /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O
Next though I 'm going to have to look at his clavicles /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The airman 's collar bones and pelvic bones prove that he was in his twenties and died in an airplane crash /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O
This is a person who likely died on impact versus perhaps freezing to death up in the mountains /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that uh the injuries were so substantial um and severe that he would n't have felt anything /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He would have died immediately /.|||O O O O O O
One two /-|||B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL O
Another important clue /.|||O O O O
He has a significant number of uh fillings /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Like the bones xrays of his wisdom teeth also tell us something about his age /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Root tips are closed /.|||O O O O O
they 're sealed up which is more indicative of someone who would be at least twenty - one years old /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
And Dr. Andy Henry notices something else /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
The airmen have straight teeth /.|||O O O O O O
so he had a nice smile good teeth /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes I would have to say that yes /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Then there are the material clues the things he had on him when he died that offer a snapshot into who he could have been /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If there 's a badge or anything else that /-|||O O O O O O O O O O
We know he was wearing a World War Two army air force uniform /.|||O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O
Remnants of his sweater undergarments and socks are still intact /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And more clues emerge from his tattered uniform a corroded nameplate this pin on his collar and this army aircorps insignia /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When I found these insignia I was happy to see them /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And our young white - haired airman also carried this black comb and some pocket change forty - five cents worth /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O
Some of these dimes are in ranging from nineteen thirty - six to nineteen forty - two /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
In his uniform breast pocket Dr. Paul Emanovsky found this vintage Schafer pen and three small leatherbound address books /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
The pages have been decomposing /.|||O O O O O O
but could they contain names of friends and loved ones /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And we 're going to put it in a spectral comparator /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
At first nothing /.|||O B-ORDINAL O O
then like magic clues begin to emerge /.|||O O O O O O O O
Uh you can see all these letters from the calendar Sunday Monday Tuesday up at the top one nine four and two /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE B-DATE B-DATE O O O O B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O
Nineteen forty - two /.|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
Yeah /.|||O O
After hours of meticulous examination of each address book they yield no personal information clues that could have faded with time /.|||O B-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And so while we still do not know who our twenty - something fair - haired airman is enormous progress has been made /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
Out of the thousands of unidentified World War Two service members Dr. Mann says they 've narrowed it down to just ten /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
So what was it like to grow up there /?|||O O O O O O O O O O
In Pleasant Grove we recently met these three sisters all in their eighties who have high hopes that the frozen airman proves to be their big brother Glen Munn whose plane went missing in the Sierra back in nineteen forty - two /.|||O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Oh I just wanted you know to know that he was found and that we can have him brought home here for burial and /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't know that though /.|||O O O O O O O
We do n't /.|||O O O O
but that 's my wishes /.|||O O O O O O
And until they learn otherwise they say they will keep that hope alive /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And in the weeks and months ahead scientists are convinced they will identify this airman and return him home to his family wherever they might be /.|||O O O B-DATE O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thelma Gutierrez CNN Honolulu Hawaii /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON B-ORG B-GPE B-GPE O
And there are some new developments to talk about tonight /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-TIME O
Scientists may be even closer to solving the mystery /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
For an update we 're joined by Dr. Robert Mann one of the senior scientists you just saw working on this cold case /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thanks for spending time with us tonight doctor /.|||O O O O O O B-TIME O O
We understand since Thelma left your laboratories you 've now wittled this down to perhaps four airmen /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
is that true /?|||O O O O
Well hi Paula /.|||O O B-PERSON O
yes we have /.|||O O O O
Uh when the remains came in a little over a week ago our analysts and historians got to work on that /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
and they were able to wittle it down the number of missing aircraft uh to a few /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and at this point they 've wittled it down to one aircraft and a missing crew of four individuals /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
So we 've gone from several possible aircraft to one aircraft and from several missing airmen to four /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
So how much easier will that make it for you to unlock this case , do you think /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I think it 'll help quite a bit /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Um any time you 've got a body uh or remains like this that has come in and they 're in pretty good condition such as this one is , it 's mummified remains /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have some soft tissue we can deal with /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
so we can look at the color of the hair /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
we can tell right away the race and the sex of the individual /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but then there are other things that are hidden beneath the soft tissue that are revealed only in the skeleton /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's where we 're going to now /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
So in the interest of full disclosure what I know about forensics is basically what I 've learned on CSI /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O
and one would think that because you 've got it now narrowed down to four potential airmen that perhaps you could go to four families get strands of hair and try to do a potential DNA match with what you 've found in the ice /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is it not that simple /?|||O O O O O O
Well no no it 's not that simple /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Um one thing we always caution people about is the pool of aircraft and missing airmen could be larger than what we 're looking at /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And what we want to do is we do n't want to just look at the material evidence that we have and immediately um jump to a conclusion that this is a certain individual /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What we want to do is have the evidence speak for itself /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and when we look at this individual as we 've done the biological profile looking at his remains his bones his teeth and the material evidence /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and what we 're able to tell from this individual is that he died in his twenties he stood somewhere between five foot nine and six foot two inches tall um he sustained massive trauma to his body on impact /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he 's Caucasoid male /.|||O O O B-NORP O O
and so we know much more now just one week later than what we did when he came in about eight days ago /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
So the most important question is when do you think you 're going to know exactly who he is /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well that 's the most commonly asked question that we have /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and you know the reality is nobody can give you the answer /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nobody knows for sure exactly when we 'll identify him /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
What it depends on is that all the lines of evidence come together for successful identification /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If I were to give my best opinion in this it would be a few weeks to a few months /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Well we 'll be keeping our fingers crossed for you /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O

I know you 've had a chance to study the plan the president put forth today /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
Does it go far enough in your estimation /?|||O O O O O O O O O
You know what 's sort of interesting Paula /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
on one hand it is remarkable that the president is devoting as much time and as much money uh all towards a disease that does n't exist yet /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pandemic flu does n't exist yet /.|||O O O O O O O
But a lot of people are talking about it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and I think that 's remarkable to a lot of people eh who are citizens and a lot of people in the public health community as well /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand to be able to outline and do the thing that were talked about today to basically completely revamp the public health system so that local officials can talk to state officials that can talk to federal officials to be able to pinpoint exactly when a cluster of bird flu happens that takes probably a lot more money and really a complete revamping of our public health systems /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other thing Paula really important is that they talk a lot about the fact that we 're a lot better at taking care of patients now than we were in nineteen eighteen , we have a lot of ICUs a lot of ICUs in the hospital behind me that can take care of critically ill patients /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The problem though at any given time eighty to ninety percent of those ICU rooms are full so we just do n't have the surge capacity and that 's going to cost lots and lots of money to create a health system where we can take care not only of the ill now but the ill that might come in with a pandemic Paula /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Uh let 's talk about the other problem of the plan where the president wants to spend a billion dollars to stockpile antiviral medicine like Tamaflu and Rolenza /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O
Do we even know if these two medications are going to be effective against a strain that has n't even presented itself /?|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's the important thing about that /.|||O O O O O O O O
We do n't know for sure /.|||O O O O O O O
A lot of people focusing a lot of energy on Tamaflu and Rolenza /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These are antiviral drugs /.|||O O O O O
they are not vaccines /.|||O O O O O
They are antiviral drugs uh designed to basically shorten uh how bad the flu might effect you uh try to lessen its impact /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we only know that it might work because of laboratory studies and animal studies uh uh in particular /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The way to really study it would be to knowingly expose people to bird flu /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and nobody will actually ever do that study for obvious reasons /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So it 's just theoretical really for the most part that those will work Paula /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O

Well the authorities including the FBI we found out had checked this witness out early on just days after Natalee disappeared /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-PERSON O O
And we just found out about this witness a couple weeks ago /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
That 's when his existence became widely known through private investigators and other sources /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it has been reported that he was afraid to come forward /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well it turns out he was just afraid for his identity to be known /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but we learned that he came forward very quickly after he says he saw what happened in the landfill that day just days after it happened /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE B-DATE I-DATE O O O O
He talked to police /.|||O O O O O

and they did n't find anything /.|||O O O O O O O
It 's the EquuSearch volunteers who really said hey we believe this guy /.|||O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
His story does n't change /.|||O O O O O O
He seems to pan out /.|||O O O O O O
He seems to be a lucid guy /.|||O O O O O O O O
He seems to also be insistent that he saw something /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So he says he saw some men drive up in a white pickup truck men that he says he later recognized to be the three suspects in this case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
He says they took what looked like a body out of the back of the pickup truck /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was wrapped up in a bag /.|||O O O O O O O O
But when the wind blew he says he saw the upper part of a woman 's body blonde hair /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then he says they buried this body there in the landfill /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well over a period of weeks some ten feet of garbage has piled up /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O O
EquuSearch will tell you too that when they bring out dogs it 's very difficult for a dog to catch a scent in that landfill when they 're coming across things like medical waste /.|||B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they 're determined to keep going /.|||O O O O O O O O
He saw uh the woman 's body and inside a bag /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her hair was blowing out with the wind /.|||O O O O O O O O O
And uh he did n't say this now /.|||O O O O O O O O O
but he told that the back kind of came off and he saw half of the woman 's body /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of the most compelling reasons searchers say they believe this guy very much is that they say he gave them some clues as to things they would find buried deep within that garbage around that same area where he claims he saw a body things like a plastic pool /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said that there was a dirt road buried under all that garbage /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well they found those things and a couple of other items that he said would be there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The problem is they just have n't found any sign at all of Natalee Holloway /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
but they want to clear that place out and just feel satisfied that they looked as best they could because it 's disturbing /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean his story has panned out in some ways /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
so they do n't want to give this up /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Well that 's the question I have for you Michelle /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
So are you saying that the authorities uh looked into this guy 's story early on and they kind of pooh - poohed it and then EquuSearch came in a couple weeks later and said wait a sec , wait a sec , let 's give this guy a shot here and they followed up on it /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah pretty much /.|||O O O O
Uh the witness told us directly that in the beginning he felt like nobody was believing his story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we talked to a high level source in law enforcement /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it turns out they did check it out /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Hm /.|||O O
They sent the FBI out there with a dog /.|||O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
But EquuSearch says hey maybe we can do something more thoroughly here /.|||O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O
We can bring out teams of dogs /.|||O O O O O O O O
But here 's the thing /.|||O O O O O O
They still have n't found one sign of her /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
but uh they are determined to keep it up through the weekend at least /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O
Alright Michelle Kosinski as always thanks a lot /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O
And as Michelle reported Natalee 's mother Beth Holloway Twitty met with the lead prosecutor in the investigation this afternoon Karin Janssen where she told Janssen about a girl came forward said she had an encounter with Joran Van Der Sloot the chief suspect /.|||O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
And on our program last night Beth told me the story /.|||O O O O B-TIME I-TIME B-PERSON O O O O O
A beautiful eighteen year old blonde - headed girl from New Jersey um you know was able to recount an encounter that she had with Joran Van Der Sloot Deepak Kalpoe and Satish Kalpoe during the month of April oh five /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
And what did she say happened /?|||O O O O O O O
you know it 's a pretty long scenario /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We have a lot of details /.|||O O O O O O O
Um you know the main thing to to sum it up as you know Joran how he entered this establishment /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
I believe that you know if you enter on the right side you have to have a valid ID /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You enter Carlos N' Charlie 's on the left side you must have some type of I do n't know if it 's a VIP pass or what to enter /.|||O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but Joran enters the establishment on the left side +approaches these group of tourist /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um you know it 's interesting how he is able to um try to work his way in and connect establish himself in uh Carlos N' Charlie 's /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Was walking her around and these other tourists and was able to point out Satish and Deepak Kalpoe /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
They 're sitting ironically in the same corner the same stools that they were seated at in the picture that 's been all over international media /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So that must be their spot where they wait while Joran is working /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
And um you know it was so interesting how everyone in the casino knew Joran /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
you know he knew everyone was greeting all the guys with this grip handshake /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the girls approach him with a kiss on the cheek /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was interesting how um you know he was able to order these group of girls by just merely leaning over the bar and ordering three shots of one fifty - one one for himself and three for the tourists with no money /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT B-CARDINAL O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
So he 's got an open uh tab at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
able to run a tab /.|||O O O O O O
And you know then you notice that in a evening 's proceeding he 's even approaching these girls getting close to closing time /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Did /.|||O O
So that 's another unique pattern that he has /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
did she say uh anything about uh violence /?|||O O O O O O O O O
No she did n't say anything about violence /.|||O O O O O O O O O
but what I was looking for was a history is a predatory type behavior which I think Joran and Deepak and Satish have and how tightly connected the three are /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
Now i- /.|||O O O
Joining me now is the private investigator who has been uh working with Natalee 's family TJ Ward and his associate Harold Phipps /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Gentlemen thanks very much uh for coming on the program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
+Appreciate it /.|||O O O
Thank you /.|||O O O
TJ let me start with you on this issue of this woman uh who came up uh to Beth /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Have you been able to follow up on that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and how relevant do you think it is /?|||O O O O O O O O O
Uh we have n't followed up with it /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Um Beth and I have talked about it /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
and we will be following up on it uh here shortly /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
is it relevant /?|||O O O O
I mean a lot of my viewers wrote in saying alright so what /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this guy 's a pickup artist /.|||O O O O O O O
how does that really impact the case /?|||O O O O O O O O
Well it just shows it 's a pattern of um what his activity is when he hangs out at Carlos N' Charlie 's /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
I mean and trying to pick women up and take them from the bar and whatever he 's doing with them after that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if there 's no violence associated with that does that help you in the investigation /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well again we do n't think there was a violent issue with him with Natalee /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
We think probably +something has happened to Natalee /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
and they panicked and then went forth and did what they were supposed to do /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean there 's issues that 's come up /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Um um well we feel something happened when Natalee was with them /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
What do you mean by that /?|||O O O O O O O
Either she either passed out regurgitated /.|||O O O O O O O
um something had happened /.|||O O O O O
And on top of that now there 's a statement that 's come up from Joran Van Der Sloot that he 's given to the police uh one of twenty - two statements he 's given by the way that um Deepak had uh raped her and killed her on the beach /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
So at this point what the police have you know again we 're unaware because we 're not getting any information from law enforcement /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so we have to go on the course of information that we 're gathering on behalf of the family /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well let me ask Harold how do you all know that /?|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
I mean that information for example about that particular statement that TJ was just mentioning /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
How do we know that /?|||O O O O O O
Yeah how do you know that that statement was actually made by Joran Van Der Sloot /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
Oh we do n't /.|||O O O O O
This is the statements that were being attributed to us on those /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh since we have n't interviewed Joran we do n't know exactly what he has said /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
but some of that statement has been let out /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and uh through a chain of different individuals uh uh they have told us uh what the statement was /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
TJ just so I 'm clear where are you getting that from that that statement was made by Joran about Deepak /?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O
I have seen a copy of the statement from one of the local newspapers here um Diario /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-ORG O
Um Jossy Mansur produced and showed me a copy of that statement that uh Joran Van Der Sloot made um the last time that I was here in Aruba /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
and uh he conveyed it from Dutch into English and uh showed me the statement /.|||O O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O B-LANGUAGE O O O O O O O
Uh TJ are you in any trouble there /?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
I mean there 's been a lot of discussions about the authorities getting uh annoyed about you knocking on doors and things like that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well it 's not that /.|||O O O O O O
Um there was some /.|||O O O O O
the Aruban authorities /-|||O B-NORP O O
and we 've had conversations about this /.|||O O O O O O O O
This is squared away /.|||O O O O O
It 's been straightened out /.|||O O O O O O
Um there was uh some evidence that leaked out to the fact that had an arrest warrant for my arrest on Wednesday and that I was working without a work permit and I was going to be deported by law enforcement and Wednesday night the law enforcement was looking for me to arrest me /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh all that is untrue /.|||O O O O O O
and I want to make that perfectly clear /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Uh this was brought up by another media station here on the island that uh made claim to that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I can to assure /.|||O O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
It 's not true /.|||O O O O O
We 'll move on /.|||O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
Yes /.|||O O
Alright /.|||O O
Um uh Harold finally this landfill /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O
Uh are you hopeful uh that EquuSearch is going to find something /?|||O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
How credible do you think that witness is who says that he saw three men dumping what looked like a blonde body /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Well uh as a retired FBI agent I 'm always hopeful for an outcome /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O
Uh we interviewed the individual at length /.|||O O O O O O O O
and having experienced hundreds if not thousands of interviews during my thirty - one years uh this guy was very uh online /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O
He did n't go mm ah /.|||O O O O O O O
I mean he was like telling a story /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and it did n't appear to me at all like he was coached or practiced /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
He just told a story uh from the beginning to the end /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I believe him /.|||O O O O O
I think there was something there /.|||O O O O O O O
if there is the body , whether it 's still there is another story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
There has been uh a period of time since then /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and it could have been removed again /.|||O O O O O O O O
But uh his story I think is credible /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We also had a /-|||O O O O O
TJ /.|||B-PERSON O
Sorry go ahead /.|||O O O O
finish up Harold /.|||O O B-PERSON O
No go ahead /.|||O O O O
I was just going to a- /-|||O O O O O O O
I 'm out of time /.|||O O O O O O
I was going to ask TJ bottom line do you think that you 're going to be able to crack the case in the next uh couple weeks /?|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Well it depends /.|||O O O O
I believe that law enforcement uh since the FBI 's been here has been working very credibly /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
And uh I believe that they have something um that 's probably solid enough and hopeful uh come September fourth that Joran Van Sloot will stay where he 's positioned right now /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
and that there 'll be additional arrests in this matter from uh parties and individuals that waited we already know that are possibly involved in this disappearance /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O

New York Daily News today reports that jurors are saying there were all sorts of shannanigans going on in the jury room at the Michael Jackson case , that a juror wanted to convict Jackson smuggled in a medical dictionary to prove Jackson fits the definition of a pedophile /.|||B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
She was later she says intimidated into changing her vote to not guilty /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Same juror we told you about yesterday Eleanor Cook who 's reportedly writing a tell - all book titled Guilty as Sin Free as a Bird /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O
News also reports another allegation that quote another juror sneaked a forbidden video of Court TV broadcast featuring the prosecution friendly Dianne Dimond and Nancy Grace to the jury room but a faulty VCR prevented a sneak peak /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And then a quote gang of three female jurors were such rabid Jackson fans that they cooed not my Michael when the panel discussed the felony charges against the pop idol /.|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yikes /.|||O O
Stacy Brown MSNBC analyst author of Michael Jackson the Man Behind the Mask and a name who keeps popping up with all these books /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON B-ORG O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stacy are you writing any of these books first of all /?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O
No I 'm not /.|||O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
But you actually talked to these jurors about writing a book /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's correct /.|||O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
and you were approached alright /.|||O O O O O O
I was approached /.|||O O O O
And so they are saying the things that the Daily News reports , are they not /?|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O
Well they are saying a lot more than just that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
What else they saying /?|||O O O O O
Um well eh let 's just clear up with the medical book /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She did n't actually bring it into the deliberation room /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
the jurors were meeting /.|||O O O O O
They rendezvoused at a juvenile hall in Santa Maria /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
and she bought it there /.|||O O O O O O
and as they were getting into the van they ordered it to put it back in her car /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but she wanted them to understand Ellie Cook this is that this fits Michael to a tee /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
So she wanted them to know Michael Jackson 's guilty , he 's a pedophile /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
and then what /?|||O O O O
Then she just caved /?|||O O O O O
She says she was pressured /.|||O O O O O O
Think she was threated /.|||O O O O O
and they were threatening to throw her off the jury /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Come on /.|||O O O
this is the one who 's been wanting to write a book since the beginning , right /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah absolutely /.|||O O O
Her granddaughter had put out feelers since she was picked for the jury /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What other kind of shannigans were going on back there , do they say /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well um they mentioned um as you had mentioned in your open about the Court TV video /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O
Someone had apparently taped some Court TV um stuff /.|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O
and they tried to play it /.|||O O O O O O O
Uh apparently it was a malfunction in the video tape /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
Well let me give the juror 's explanation for this /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And /.|||O O
This is Paula Coccoz /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
we talked to her today juror number ten /.|||O O O O B-DATE O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
It 's number four /.|||O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Uh the bailiff brought in a TV with a VCR so we could review the sheriff 's interview /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we went to put in the tape /.|||O O O O O O O O O
The tape was marked Court TV /.|||O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
The people at the courthouse had left this tape in the VCR /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We told the bailiff about this /.|||O O O O O O O
and he seemed concerned about whether or not we reviewed the tape /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We told them we did n't watch it /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We did n't find out until later what was on the tape /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
according to Ellie though someone taped that show /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
It was n't left there /.|||O O O O O O
Um and there was a problem /.|||O O O O O O O
Now I know that someone else mentioned that there was a problem as well with a VCR /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you remember well the interview with the sheriff and the young boy was on a disk and not a VCR /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And this is number five /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Uh this is again the Daily News /.|||O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
That Cook uh admits that she frequently winked at Jackson 's mother um Katherine in court and exchanged wardrobe tips with the entertainer 's mom which resulted in them wearing the same colors on certain days /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ellie Cook talked about that yeah /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
She mentioned that they would wink and nod at each other /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't understand /.|||O O O O O
So on the one hand this juror 's saying I was convinced he was guilty you know /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and they 're saying oh she was trying to bring in a medical text /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and on the other hand she 's sitting there winking at Katherine Jackson talking to her about what clothes they 're going to wear /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
Saying everything was going to be okay /.|||O O O O O O O O
She /-|||O O
And that 's why you did n't believe this story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's why I do n't yeah ah /.|||O O O O O O O O O
That 's why you would n't write the book /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm not writing it because I just think that there 's a lot of issues with this /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you felt that this guy was guilty , you felt he was a pedophile , he lives in your community , he 's a very powerful member of your community why let him free then /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you just not believe these jurors /?|||O O O O O O O O
Is that the problem /?|||O O O O O
I just do n't believe them /.|||O O O O O O O
Why /?|||O O
I mean they 're making this up for money /?|||O O O O O O O O O O
It 's just /-|||O O O O
well uh you know I think in both their cases they feel now in retrospect maybe we made a mistake /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And see I can live with that if that 's what they are saying /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they 're not saying that /.|||O O O O O O O
They 're saying that they believed all along he was guilty /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I 'm having a hard time with that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Alright Stacy uh stick around for a minute /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Joining me now NBC News legal analyst former prosecutor Susan Filan and attorney and Celebrity Justice executive producer Harvey Levin criminal defense attorney Daniel Horowitz /.|||O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Harv what do you make of /-|||B-PERSON O O O O O O
Look you 've followed this close /.|||O O O O O O O
What do you make of all this /?|||O O O O O O O O
Well I think Eleanor Cook is a wacko Dan /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O
and I think if any of these allegations are true these jurors need to be prosecuted /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean this is jury tampering from within the jury if these allegations are true /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if there is ever to be a fair celebrity trial again especially in California somebody needs to say look we are drawing the line /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
You 're not going to get books at the end of the rainbow and do things inappropriate /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If it pans out it 's true I think Tom Sneddon himself should prosecute without respect to whether it would have been pro or anti Michael Jackson /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
So Susan let 's assume for a minute it 's true /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O
Again you 're the prosecutor /.|||O O O O O O
and you 're sitting there going are you kidding me /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
There were two or three jurors who wanted to convict /.|||O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
and they caved because they were pressured or whatever /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
You ca n't do anything , can you /?|||O O O O O O O O O
Nothing /.|||O O
eh game over /.|||O O O O
You ca n't take an appeal from an aquittal /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
The problem that I have with this is as members of the media we had an awfully difficult time with access to this trial /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If this is going to set a precedent to shut media out because these highly publicized celebrity trials yield these faulty verdicts she 's doing far far more harm than she could ever understand /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah but let 's forget about the media stuff /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
I mean the bottom line is the prosecutors ca n't do anything about this , right /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean if the jurors were tampering with evidence , if they were playing with evidence et cetera back there the prosecutors have to just suck it up and be depressed /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's no remedy /.|||O O O O O
They have to eat it /.|||O O O O O O
It 's over /.|||O O O O
Daniel I mean Stacy does n't really believe them /.|||B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
but what do you think /?|||O O O O O O
Well Dan I believe them /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O
You know jurors are people /.|||O O O O O O
We expect them to be perfect little robots doing what the judge says /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and they do n't /.|||O O O O O
They 're going to watch television /.|||O O O O O O O
I 'm sure they all watch your show /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and they watched Susan try to convict Michael Jackson /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
but then I hope they listened to me and to reason /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the bottom line is they reached a fair and just verdict /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You have to trust people and nail those attempts to control and hypercontrol this case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just backfired /.|||O O O
It made the jurors feel isolated /.|||O O O O O O O
and now they 're all quiet /.|||O O O O O O O
They wo n't talk to us about what really went on /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Okay here 's my problem /.|||O O O O O O
It 's this woman saying she was forced and bullied right into reaching the verdict that she did /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and there she is saying I did n't like the way that this woman snapped at me talking about the accuser 's mother et cetera /. /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know Dan I do n't even talk to juries afterwards unless I win because you 're always going to hear things like that /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
People in a jury room are in a bar room brawl /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's not supposed to be pretty /.|||O O O O O O O O
and when it 's over there 's always second thoughts and regrets /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O
but it 's the system /.|||O O O O O O
and it works /.|||O O O O
Harvey you know what /.|||B-PERSON O O O O
eh hey hey if I may say /-|||O O O O O O O O
But Dan your point is that /-|||O B-PERSON O O O O O
You know a bar room brawl is one thing /.|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
They were acting like outlaws if these allegations are true /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Right /.|||O O
And you know I agree Susan that the prosecutors ca n't do anything to Michael Jackson /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
but they certainly can do something to the jurors /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and I think it is more important right now to say /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm telling you Dan you and I have covered a lot of trials in this city /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we 've seen a lot of weird things happen since OJ Simpson with books and everything else /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O
If jurors realize that there 's a back end if you will which is a Hollywood term to these trials and if they get caught so what they get caught but they can still publish a book if they believe that everything is going to change in this city /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
let me ask you /.|||O O O O O
Harv here 's the thing that I do n't understand /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And this is why Stacy made the right call on this /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Alright Stacy may say he did n't believe them whatever /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
I do n't think that many people are going to buy this book /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is that Stacy /?|||O O O O
I did n't either /.|||O O O O O
Is that the real reason you did n't want to write the book Stacy /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Well no no that 's not the b- /-|||O O O O O O O O O
You did n't think you were going to make any money /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Come on /.|||O O O
That 's the real reason , is n't it /?|||O O O O O O O O O O
No /.|||O O
the real reason is Dan believe it or not I have a conscience /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
I wrote Man Behind the Mask with Bob Jones because I believed in Bob Jones /.|||O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
and I still believe in the material /.|||O O O O O O O O
I do n't believe in this material /.|||O O O O O O O O
uh Harvey do you agree with me that the book 's not really going to sell much /?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely /.|||O O
For two reasons /.|||O B-CARDINAL O O
Number one I think it would have been a better book if he would have been found guilty /.|||B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And secondly I think the credibility of the authors um mean a whole lot /.|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and eh you know I just think everything is so off - kilter people are n't going to be particularly interested in it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes /.|||O O
Yeah /.|||O O

We 've been cooperating with the FBI and the US Attorney 's Office in their investigation /.|||O O O O O O B-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O
and we 'll continue to do so /.|||O O O O O O O O
However we 've been asked by the authorities not to speak with the media while the investigation is pending /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we intend to honor that request /.|||O O O O O O O O
This photo taken the day shows what appears to be blood on the awning below the cabin where Smith and his wife were staying /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O

Alright so Susan what do you know about the investigation /?|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Well NBC news has learned from a law enforcement source that the wife is not a suspect and that they are focusing in on these two Russian brothers as you said who live in Brooklyn /.|||O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL B-NORP O O O O O O O B-GPE O
The California teen is apparently the key to the case at this point /.|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's law enforcement 's focus /.|||O O O O O O O
If this young man will talk this could break open what happened to George /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
The key question is is this a tragic accident or is this foul play /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right now law enforcement seems to think it 's foul play /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
US attorney Kevin O'Connor said we have reason to believe there could have been foul play here /.|||B-GPE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um alright uh Mister Zalisko do you know anything from your personal experience of having been on the cruise as to what happened /?|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh good evening sir /.|||O O O O O
Uh first I 'd just like to clarify I 'm a police chief in Oak Hill Florida not Orlando /.|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE B-GPE O B-GPE O
Uh now as far as the cruise uh I was on the cruise that uh uh day /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
and the way I became aware of what occured was that uh the morning of the fifth a relative of mine had mentioned that there was blood stain on the canopy beneath her uh balcony /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at that point we kind of dismissed it /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We did n't know what was uh going on /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Uh we then went on our daily excursion /.|||O O O O O O O O O
However later on into the cruise that day uh the ship 's captain went onto the PA system and made an announcement that uh authorities were on the ship and they were investigating the possibility that an individual had gone overboard during the night or early morning hours /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
When I asked my cousin the uh size of the blood splatter she had indicated it was relatively the size of a small uh dog of a beagle type /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However viewing those photographs on TV that blood splatter is much larger than uh a small dog /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
In fact it 's maybe three to four feet in length /.|||O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O
And then we 've been hearing many stories that uh there were a lot of people going into and out of the state rooms uh which would indicate that the crime scene was not properly secured in the early stages of the investigation /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well /.|||O O
Alright let me play this piece of sound from one of the passengers who was uh staying right nearby uh this particular uh room /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were awakened uh about four in the morning uh by loud yelling coming from the cabin /.|||O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O
Um it sounded like people uh cheering uh like a drinking contest type thing /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he says uh later um chief that he heard a horrific thud /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well yeah that would indicate that something did go on there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we know uh that the three individuals were in a room uh with Mister Smith /.|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
And the question that has to be uh presented to everybody is why is it taking so long for authorities to interview the individual that was in a cabin next door /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
Any seasoned investigator would know that you would want to conduct your interviews uh of possible witnesses immediately after the crime /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
Yeah /.|||O O
And you would not just interview that individual next door /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You would have to take a step to interview people above below and to both sides /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Susan what 's the answer to that /?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O
But Dan /.|||O B-PERSON O
there are jurisdictional problems here /.|||O O O O O O
You know it 's not a clear cut case as to who gets to prosecute this case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Turkey ca n't do anything without a body /.|||B-GPE O O O O O O O O
United States can /.|||B-GPE I-GPE O O
Fair play of the United States for stepping in /.|||O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O
fair play to law enforcement for getting involved /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Jurisdiction is n't clear /.|||O O O O O
but they 're working very hard to solve the crime /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't think the criticism is well placed against law enforcement in this case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also the crime scene oh if you want to call it that was cleaned up by the cruise ship who got their investigators and their lawyers in from what I understand right away to make this go away /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so I think law enforcement was put in a bad position trying to play catchup /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I think they 're doing +an amazing job /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Larry so uh any chance now based on the fact that things have been cleaned up et cetera to get any usable evidence /?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well it 's very difficult Dan /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O
Uh obviously as we keep saying we do not have a body /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
therefore we do not have a cause or a manner of the death /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we do have some physical evidence /.|||O O O O O O O O
Unfortunately examination of the photograph uh tells me it was not done the proper way /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was n't a forensic photograph /.|||O O O O O O O
So I really do not know how large the stain was in its dimensions /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it is pretty clear that there 's a lot of blood there great deal of blood /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It makes you think that something criminal occured /.|||O O O O O O O O O
But again getting back to how you solve the crime you got to go to the crime scene /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I think there are multiple scenes here /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Every place there 's blood it 's a crime scene /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the most important place is the cabin because that 's presumably where the injury took place /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now there was some rumor about some arguments going casino the night before /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
Uh and it could very well be that he was arguing with these individuals /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so uh that could be the tie the connection /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and I think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with Mister Smith /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
and that might help us understand what happened /.|||O O O O O O O O O
this is um a little bit more sound /.|||O O O O O O O O O
This is again from Cletus Hyman uh who was literally um in a joining or nearby cabin um as to what he heard around he said four in the morning the day before uh Mister Smith went missing /.|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME B-DATE I-DATE O O O B-PERSON O O O
At times it sounded like furniture was being actually picked up and dropped /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then that horrific uh thud /.|||O O O O O O O
Yeah I mean that sure sounds to me chief like we 're not talking about someone who /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean I guess it 's possible if you 're talking about loud yelling coming /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well look if this guy 's right that loud yelling is coming from the cabin right and the wife is not a real suspect here means that there was probably someone else in there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well there absolutely was someone else in that room /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
And what 's interesting is there was a witness who uh had informed ship 's authorities that she had heard a scream uh early that morning /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
And what 's really interesting is uh we do n't know if she 's been interviewed at this point /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it was five days later that the ship 's attorneys had begun to question her not law enforcement but ship 's attorneys /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We will uh continue to follow this /.|||O O O O O O O O

You knew it was wrong /.|||O O O O O O
and you chose not to think about it /.|||O O O O O O O O O

Joining me now is Samantha Runnion 's mother Erin Runnion and Dru Sjodin 's mother Linda Walker /.|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Thanks so much uh for coming on the program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
We appreciate it /.|||O O O O
Alright Erin let me start with you /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O
What do you think the biggest problem is out there when it comes to these sex offenders /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I think that there 's a gross misconception about sex offender crimes /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think most do not realize how pervasive the problem is /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sex offenders that we have caught are a very small percentage of those that are out there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Statistically one in four girls and as many as one in six to ten boys are sexually assaulted before they are eighteen /.|||O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-DATE O
That 's nationwide /.|||O O O O
This problem is much bigger than I think people are realizing /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And Linda I guess what we 're realizing as we have been highlighting these wanted sex offenders around the country is how many of them are still out there and wanted /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well currently there 's um right now uh over a hundred thousand that are missing /.|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O
Unbelievable /.|||O O
Uh we know that there 's over five hundred thousand registered /.|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O
So yes there 's a vast amount that are running uh through the system /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's a May of two thousand five um statistic /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O
but as far as those before that time and date /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um Linda eh how much has this eh when I say changed your life I mean in addition to the obvious loss of your daughter but in terms of what you are doing everyday with your life /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both of you have devoted much of your lives to this cause now /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Linda why do n't you tell me a little bit about what you 've been doing /.|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well um I 've been working with um er pardon me Byron Dorgan Senator of North Dakota /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-GPE I-GPE O
um working legislation on what has been uh called Dru 's Law which we hope will be a national sex +offender uh database through computer /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-LAW I-LAW I-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And um obviously we know that this nation is more and um they 're able to access cross you know state lines /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so I think it 's important that uh people of predators living amongst us across you know the country and be vigilant uh besides uh leaving the pressure on them /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mhm /.|||O O
Yeah /.|||O O
Erin uh every time I listen to that tape of you um talking to uh your dau- I get chills /.|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um was it at all uh cathartic for you to be able to stand across from him /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Definitely /.|||O O
Definitely I to say what I said to him /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
I needed to address him /.|||O O O O O O
And I feel like I got it off my chest you know /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I hope to never ever see him again /.|||O O O O O O O O O
The whole trial process is really built around the defendant /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and um it was very important to me that I bring it back around and make it about Samantha because that 's what it was really about /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
Do you watch these other stories uh in the news /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and does it just get your blood boiling as you see eh these cases where was on the loose should have been arrested could 've been /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know the technology is there /.|||O O O O O O O
so yes it infuriates me /.|||O O O O O O
I ca n't understand why we 're so behind in terms of tracking sex offenders /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I really think it 's because people do n't real- /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's no reason that there should n't be a nationwide movement to stop these people . To have them register at the very least have them their driver 's licenses /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If they do n't they go on a most wanted list /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's made public nationwide /.|||O O O O O O
At the very least every state could do that /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
it adds to state revenue /.|||O O O O O O
it does n't take away /.|||O O O O O O
It 's a good way to track them /.|||O O O O O O O O O
And I have to just on a personal note applaud Linda /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
I met her before they had found Dru /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
and I 'm so sorry for your loss /.|||O O O O O O O O O
I think you 're just amazing /.|||O O O O O O O
You 're doing such a job /.|||O O O O O O O
Well as well for you too /.|||O O O O O O O
Thank you /.|||O O O
Linda are you psychologically prepared uh for this trial /?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
I mean eh you know you can tell from seeing on that tape that obviously it 's not easy stuff /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean to sit there next to these guys /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
You know it 's just another part of this whole sick story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there 's no script for it /.|||O O O O O O O
I do n't know if anyone could ever be prepared /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um obviously it 's something that um we look to have it put behind us so we can really dwell more on what Dru gave us in her life and not how tragically she was taken from us /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And also I have to say that what both of you are doing in working with legislators uh to move forward uh to not just say we 're going to only look past /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both of you are doing /.|||O O O O O O
and that 's why we 're so um glad and proud to have you both on the program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's because of what both of you are doing to have things change /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
um and I think that is what 's /-|||O O O O O O O O O
Go ahead Linda /.|||O O B-PERSON O
Well and uh thanks goes to you and to the media to help us /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely /.|||O O
Obviously we could n't scream loud enough uh to bring the attention /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so our hat is off to all of you as well /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
Yeah and that 's /-|||O O O O O
And to realize you know why we 're out here doing what we 're doing on the scale that we 're able to /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's why I have to tell you on this special series we 're doing I 'm just getting so tired of hearing these stories about these guys where they were always on the loose and people say oh you know it would have been nice if he was captured /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tired of it /.|||O O O O
and as a result you know we 're doing the little bit that we can /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you guys are the ones who are really going to get things done /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Your voices your presence um I think is really the difference /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's why I thank you both so much for coming on the program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well thank you /.|||O O O O
Well thank you /.|||O O O O
it 's /.|||O O O
And you know it 's so important we know too /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Absolutely /.|||O O
Absolutely /.|||O O
It 's so important that people realize at home that in our own homes in our own lives we can work to prevent these crimes /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is really just about uh communicating with neighbors getting a watch going in your community talking /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Report every suspicious behavior there is /.|||O O O O O O O
You never know /.|||O O O O
It leads to convictions time and time again /.|||O O O O O O O O O

Uh No /.|||O O O
It 's too important /.|||O O O O O
They saw the evidence /.|||O O O O O
The only thing that might 've changed their minds this quickly I think is money or peer pressure neither of which are very good reasons /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Um , this is the first time I 've seen you , and I 've always wanted to ask you a question .|||O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah .|||O O
Usually directors , otherwise , they have beards and very long hair , or otherwise they shave their heads .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh .|||O O
Oh ! I had n't thought about that .|||O O O O O O O O O
Actually a shaved head is really hard to manage , is n't it ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you have to shave it every day ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Right , yes .|||O O O O
Um , when I 've slept so much I ca n't wake up , I just shave my head and I 'm awake .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And do you need to polish it somehow ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Then do you rub a little oil of some kind on it ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh , after I shave it I rub on a little oil .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is it cold in the winter ?|||O O O O O O O
Pretty cold .|||O O O
Do you wear a hat ?|||O O O O O O
In the winter ?|||O O O O
It forces me to wear a hat .|||O O O O O O O O
That 's a question I 've always wanted to ask .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , I 'm sure that there are many people when they introduce you , aside from saying Director Ye Daying who has shot such and such , they ca n't avoid the cliche , they always have to say " I 'd like to introduce Marshall Ye Ting 's grandson . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
Your father , Ye Zhengming , was Marshall Ye Ting 's second child .|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORDINAL O O
Right .|||O O
Oh !|||O O
But today we 're telling Ye Daying 's story .|||O B-DATE O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Let 's start with when you were young .|||O O O O O O O O O
When you were young you were very naughty .|||O O O O O O O O O
Ye Daying was born in Changchun in 1958 .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-GPE O B-DATE O
Although by that time his grandfather Ye Ting had been dead for 12 years , the Ye family maintained its status as a highly esteemed Communist household .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
The next year the entire family transferred to Beijing , and Ye Daying spent his childhood there .|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-GPE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
He and his little friends went fishing , raised dogs , hunted sparrows , chased ducks , and many years later these supremely happy memories are all preserved in his movies and plays .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One , two , three , four .|||B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O
Ducks were the most precious asset in our village .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The village mayor gave them all to me .|||O O O O O O O O O
The mayor said to me , there are eighty - six in all ;|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O
he had me check to see that there were none missing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I never did count them all carefully .|||O O O O O O O O O
77 , 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86|||B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL
Did you see ?|||O O O O
Are there 86 of them ?|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O
Yes .|||O O
Ye Daying 's mother , An Qi , was an educated woman who worked at the Changchun Film Studio .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
And his father , Ye Zhengming , was an outstanding son of the revolution .|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
Because after the Wannan Incident Ye Zhengming and his father Ye Ting were imprisoned for two years in a Kuomnintang prison .|||O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-ORG O O
But then , and for the same reasons , just after the Cultural Revolution started , Ye Zhengming was treated as a major capitalist roader .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
That year Ye Daying was just eight years old .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
His family 's sudden misfortune left the young Ye Daying with very disturbing memories .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
He changed from a very well - behaved child into a naughty child .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From that time on he often did things that went beyond the norm , sometimes to protect himself and sometimes to take care of his family .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ye Daying just corrected us ; he said that Ye Ting should not be called Marshal Ye Ting but rather General Ye Ting .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Right , right , right , General Ye Ting .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Why , is there a big difference between marshal and general ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , he died in '46 .|||O O O O O B-DATE O
That marshal , afterward , after Liberation , um , it was conferred on him , so only then --|||O O O O O O B-EVENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Mm .|||O O
Because ,|||O O
Very naughty ?|||O O O
To what extent were you naughty then ?|||O O O O O O O O
In fact I was a very well - behaved child .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But I was , forced into it , , if you were n't naughty there was no way to survive .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What do you mean forced into it ?|||O O O O O O O O
During the Cultural Revolution , , um , my family was considered capitalist roaders .|||O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O O O O O O
So the kids then did n't want to play with you , or they would tease you , that sort of thing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So you always had to be fighting with people , such things ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why was that ?|||O O O O
Was it because people for example would say that your father was such and such , or your family was such and such .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
So it was because of that sort of thing ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Right , the majority of it was like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm .|||O O
Because you had to face them alone , OK , a dozen people who wanted to fight you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
You had to show your stuff right off the bat , and you had to be tough .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So that was , the only way you could overcome them and get the upper hand .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Were you tough ?|||O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Very tough .|||O O O
Tough enough to --|||O O O O
Because , there was no way , if you were n't tough that was it , , how could you manage .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You were the son of capitalist roaders , , you thought it was natural to be the object of bullying , and it 's perfectly normal .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
, I remember one time , we were digging out an air - raid shelter , that --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Those , good kids , they went there and threw stones .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did n't dare defend myself , so I just had to endure it for quite a while .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Finally a very big rock , a lump of earth , hit me on the head , And I got angry , so angry that I rushed out with a shovel and hit them with the shovel .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Where did the shovel come from ?|||O O O O O O O
From digging the air - raid shelter , it was there , right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So you picked up the shovel and rushed them .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Did you crack somebody 's head open ?|||O O O O O O O O
Mm , anyhow , yes , I cracked their head open , it was very tragic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of a sudden nobody was making a sound .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Very --|||O O
Once I fought back , for several years after nobody dared mess with me .|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O
How many of them did you take out ?|||O O O O O O O O O
I hit one of them and that was enough .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Nopbody went to get the schoolmaster or somebody 's father ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They did , and there was a huge fuss .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Because when I was little , having a big fight like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Anyhow , more or less , , on average , every two years I changed school , and that 's how it had to be .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
I remember one time -- Mm , also , when I was in fifth or sixth grade , someone yelled out , Down with Ye Zhengming , he was yelling at me , and I had to fight them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
After the fight I went home , and my father was standing far away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, the factory , , on the street , somebody had written in huge letters Down with Ye Zhengming , , the slogan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
I got accustomed to it while passing by at that time , and now when I think about it , it seems very much like a stage play .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Back then I felt , looking at him standing so far away --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I walked over to him , and he said , um , you really do n't understand anything .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the time I felt like I had a grievance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And I felt , I was fighting for you , the people were cursing you , and I was fighting them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact that 's the way kids think .|||O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
You think , you bastard .|||O O O O O O
What you say does n't count .|||O O O O O O O
you come after me and I 'll take you down .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You come down , and I 'll take you down .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If you have balls , you come on down .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Come on down .|||O O O O
Come down .|||O O O
Come down , come on , fight , fight , fight .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I say you take a whack .|||O O O O O O O
Whack .|||O O
I 'm telling you , if you kill somebody you 'll pay with your life , do you understand ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, You 've already handed him over .|||O O O O O O O O
I sent someone .|||O O O O
OK , OK , I sent someone , so you come on and take a shot at me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Come on , take a whack at me .|||O O O O O O O O O
Take a whack at me .|||O O O O O O
Your dad knows who broke the window .|||O O O O O O O O
Take a whack .|||O O O O
Take a whack .|||O O O O
Take a whack .|||O O O O
Are n't you willing to be friends with us ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I am .|||O O O O O
He says he 's willing .|||O O O O O O
Did you hear ?|||O O O O
He says he 's willing .|||O O O O O O
Ok , that 's all right , let 's go play .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a movie directed by Ye , called There 's a Place Called Wangjiazhan .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O
Wangjiazhuang , right .|||B-GPE O O O
This is obviously him as a boy , uh , a memory of his childhood life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Right .|||O O
Which child is you .|||O O O O O
Is this child you , or is that child you ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Actually we should be accurate ; this child 's experiences ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So this child ,|||O O O O
Um , right , right , right , because once , I|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
My father was denounced , and then the rebels took us , took that child to see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
They denounced my father , so I was very indignant ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They let a lot of people expose my father ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Then the day after I took a kitchen knife and ran over to their home , that research institute , the doorway and vowed that I 'd hack the guy up .|||O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A kitchen knife ; a knife from your kitchen at home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh , right , right , a knife from my kitchen at home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I was standing there , lots of people surrounding me , and in fact you ca n't just hack people up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I had already said it .|||O O O O O O O
What did you say ?|||O O O O O
said I have to hack him , have to hack , so it was more or less like this child .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , those adults standing around reasoned with me , said look , you do n't understand this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you do this , you 'll stir up more trouble , and then wo n't your dad be even worse off ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact when they said that , my mind had already eased .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could not lose the face this way , , So then I ran over and took a whack at the door , to get an excuse for myself .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Was it all ruined ? The door --|||O O O O O O O O
I slashed it twice .|||O O O O O
Um , was n't there any consequence ?|||O O O O O O O O
Mm , there was no consequence , , I just let the adults reason with me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , and this is a memory from your childhood years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It , had a great influence on me .|||O O O O O O O O O
Including that village , that environment , it 's all very familiar to you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
More or less , very close to me , this is a novel of .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm .|||O O
, the reason I like it is because , um , it brings up lots of that kind of childhood memories .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , you spent a large part of your childhood in Beijing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
What year was it that you moved to Shanghai ?|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
How old were you at that time ?|||O O O O O O O O
, In '69 I was 11 years old .|||O O B-DATE O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm , well .|||O O O O
In '69 at the age of 11 you went from Beijing to Shanghai .|||O B-DATE O O O O B-DATE O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O
Mm , your living environment changed , but perhaps that mischievousness had n't completely passed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , as he puts it , looking at it now , some of the memories can be very painful , but it was pretty happy days .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I went there every day and then they suspended classes , , so I could n't go to school , could n't go to class .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So , later I remember there was -- Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A lot of people were very happy , very excited , because they were bringing back the college entrance exams , why were you feeling so depressed ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , but the problem --|||O O O O O O
Because , I had never studied well ,|||O O O O O O O O
In 1966 the Great Cultural Revolution came , and at that time Ye Daying 's family moved from Beijing to Shanghai to live .|||O B-DATE B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O
His father Ye Zhengming was being criticized as a capitalist roader at the research institute , and the political situation was getting worse by the day .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the change of regions did nothing to change the violent nature of Ye Daying 's life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
He was still struggling at the edge of preserving justice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
When you got to Shanghai the environment changed ; did n't your whole person change ?|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
After I got to Shanghai , , settling into , , that ,|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
All that time , from '69 to '76 , I graduated from senior middle school , it all took place there .|||O O O O O B-DATE O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
At that time in school , there were some special children , there was a special class , the better students , were you in that class ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , right , , see , like study classes to educate good kids .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What kind of people were in your class ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Um .|||O O
Anyhow , boys and girls who did not perform well , you could say they were little hooligans , they were all mixed in together in that class , and there were also some who had problems at home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
All of them , and every day I went there , and the classes were suspended , , so they did n't let me go to school , did n't let me go to class .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So , afterward , I remember there was Mm . A guy in the engineering team , and he brought Quotations from Chairman Mao and said to me , He said , now take this , now take these Quotations from Chairman Mao and teach yourselves , and in the future you 'll take up arms and teach yourselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lots of fun .|||O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So I was with this group of kids all together , and everybody copied everybody else and it was even harder to study .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact it was n't that we did n't study , I think it was ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This class really helped me a lot , , sometimes in my life I think about this ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
That period was both a happy and a fun time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Because I was a good egg .|||O O O O O O O
In this I go against the grain .|||O O O O O O O O
Um , the thing is , , they 're all the same .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you 're bad , you do what you want , and so , you 're honest and so it 's easy to be free .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plus when you yourself have already decided that you 're a bad kid , then , you achieve a kind of liberation , and you 're completely liberated and free .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that --|||O O O O
Um , of course today we say , at that time , um , in that class of ours , they were n't all necessarily bad kids .|||O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
They just were n't like normal kids .|||O O O O O O O O
, it was like a brotherhood .|||O O O O O O O
Ah , and we did some things that were out of bounds .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , we helped each other .|||O O O O O O O
Very sincere , very sincere and good .|||O O O O O O O O
When he was in that class , Ye Daying received patient teaching every day .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O
At that time he encountered the first love of his life that still remains fresh in his memory .|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
This girl became the only light in Ye Daying 's dark life for several years .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
In those days if a middle school student liked a fellow - student , how did he go about expressing that ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um .|||O O
When I was a school kid , for example , Um , that girl , who ran the kitchen and was one of the better students in our class , I liked her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
I always felt , um , she can , give you more on your plate , put more things on your plate for you to eat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And then the most obvious way was um , to go see a movie together .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
It was ,|||O O O
So already you could -- Go see a movie ; I thought ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That was it , that was it .|||O O O O O O O O
You just want to go see the movie , you do n't worry about holding hands or not , um , and that was great , --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So you went to the movies with this girl ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Do you still remember what movies you saw ?|||O O O O O O O O O
The Flower Girl .|||B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART
I still remember that now .|||O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
She cried as hard as she could .|||O O O O O O O O
So seeing The Flower Girl was the equivalent of seeing Titanic now .|||O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O O
Oh , yes , yes , a bit , a bit , yes , all was ready , no cry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , crying her eyes out , a big film like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the time I thought I would n't cry .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But the people all around were crying , and I thought if I did n't cry it would look bad .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So then you cried .|||O O O O O
So then I thought , I should let my emotions go .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , how was the girl , was she very pretty ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
, now I remember that she was very pretty , mm .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
She was a very good student .|||O O O O O O O
Ha ha , this --|||O O O O O
How was it she liked you ?|||O O O O O O O
At that time we did n't talk about it , if two people gave each other the eye and felt it was right , then ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gave each other the eye , while you were in the class you gave each other the eye .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, so , when we were in class , for example you ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I remember how it happened , yes .|||O O O O O O O O
Um . When we went to class , in the classroom , it was all very chaotic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm .|||O O
So then , we 'd each pick up a piece of chalk and toss the chalk back and forth . And throw spitballs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I threw it at someone else but missed , and it hit her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The result was that she turned her head to look .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And she looked at you angrily .|||O O O O O O O
I thought , uh-oh , the expression in her eyes was like she would forgive you , that kind of feeling .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought wow , it 's so wonderful , that kind of feeling .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
That 's how it was , I should say .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It was like that ?|||O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Many years later , afterward , we graduated from senior middle school , and I was still going to see her .|||B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
The --|||O O
, so we all took the exams for college , and things changed , right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You graduated from middle school in '73 .|||O O O O O O B-DATE O
'74 .|||B-DATE O
Mm .|||O O
Graduated from midle school in '74 .|||O O O O O B-DATE O
Mm , that female schoolmate went to the Shanghai suburbs to live and work .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
Right , right , yes .|||O O O O O O
Ye Daying went to work in a factory ; at that time your monthly wages were , forty - some yuan ?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O
Mm , when I started it was a technical school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then at first it was 13 yuan , the first year 13 yuan ; the second year it was 15 yuan , and the third year it was 41 yuan .|||O O B-ORDINAL O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-MONEY I-MONEY O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O
Mm .|||O O
Mm .|||O O
41 yuan , at the time , for him , it was , an astronomical sum , um , a lot of money .|||B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was a lot of money .|||O O O O O O O
In 1976 , there were two happy events in the Ye family .|||O B-DATE O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O B-PERSON O O
The first was that his father , Ye Zhengming , was released and reunited with his family that he had been separated from for three years .|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
The second event was that Ye Daying had his 18th birthday and became an adult .|||O B-ORDINAL O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
With the turn for the better in his father 's political circumstances , Ye Daying left behind his violent life and changed suddenly , becoming more inward - looking .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 1978 the big news was that the college entrance exams would be reinstated nationwide , and people of Ye Daying 's age were thrilled .|||O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
However , at this time Ye Daying , facing this opportunity that would change his fortune , was at a loss as to what to do .|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You thought those days were pretty good , did you not think about getting into the university ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Oh my , in fact , '78 , for me , was an especially depressing time .|||O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm .|||O O
Up to then , um , I had never thought about the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
I thought everybody was the same , your fate settled things for you , um , you either go to a place live and work , or you became a -LRB- factory -RRB- worker .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In society , being a worker was already not so bad a thing , um , a way to move ahead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , in '78 suddenly they reinstated the college entrance exams .|||O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O
At that time , in '78 , I was 20 .|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O B-DATE O
A lot of people were happy , very excited , because they reinstated the college entrance exams ; why were you feeling depressed ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , but the problem was , , Because , I had never done well in school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So right off I felt that I was finished , --|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Those kids who were younger than us who had done well in school , , compared to me , they had a future , um , they could stand out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So I was hopeless , right off I was feeling down .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very clearly a --|||O O O O
If you wanted to take the exams , what kind of score did you think you 'd get .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did n't take the exams , I did n't have the nerve , I did n't try , so --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, the extraordinary thing was , at that time my mom was attending the film institute , she was an instructor there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm , I had n't thought , , that I would work in the movie .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
, um , she wanted to send the recruitment announcement to a friend 's house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
So then I --|||O O O O
One day she sent me to deliver it , and so I picked it up and read it , and once I read it , oh ! The directing department of the film institute , inside , no language exams , no math or physics or chemistry exams , and I thought wow ! This is just the ticket .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's run off to try and see .|||O O O O O O O O O
I thought you 've loved movies ever since you were little , and then every day sitting in the movie theater you thought , I want to be a director .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , I did n't , no .|||O O O O O O O O
It was just because there was no English exam , no exams in math or physics or chemistry .|||O O O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , it was very simple .|||O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
One more thing , because in '78 , the Beijing Film Institute was recruiting students in Shanghai --|||O O O O O O B-DATE O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O B-GPE O
Right .|||O O
So , Ye Daying went to take the exams for the film institute , but did n't pass the exams .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His mother , An Qi , had never thought that Ye Daying would sign up to take the exam for her work unit , the Beijing Film Institute .|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
But Ye Daying in fact failed when he took the reinstated exam .|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
Although it was the first time he had taken the exam , it left Ye Daying even more convinced that movies were something he could do .|||O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
The next year , 21 - year - old Ye Daying passed the entrance exam for the actors training class at the Xi'an Film Studio .|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Being an actor was not his goal ; he hoped rather to get into the directing profession .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At that time you especially admired directors , right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , because after I got to the Xi'an Film Studio , um , I discovered I had the shakes when I got on stage .|||O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm .|||O O
Mm . Now , here chatting with you , I feel , um , it does n't matter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even today , in front of the lens , I 'm a nervous wreck .|||O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mm , very tense .|||O O O O O
Did you act then ?|||O O O O O
Of course , every day we had to , um , it was n't just recitation , so , doing sketches , this and that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought , this is definitely not working .|||O O O O O O O O O
Just getting on stage gave you the shakes .|||O O O O O O O O O
Then , , no , it was n't my thing , this , I could n't find out why , and besides in those days ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , it was in '80 that I went to the Xi'an Film Studio ,|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Mm .|||O O

Let 's talk a little bit more about what the Navy does to prevent such tragedies .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
We were talking about it this morning and we put together some graphics for you .|||O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O
I 'll try to explain it the best I can from what I remember from being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT O
This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the Navy does with regard to prevention .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
, every sailor that 's entering the Navy does take a swim test .|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
They learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They also wear float coats .|||O O O O O O
You can see them here .|||O O O O O O
The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Everything is color coordinated .|||O O O O O
You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and they have toggles to pull and inflate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They also have a manual device so if the toggles do n't work they can blow air into the inflation device .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have dive goggles and they 're able to find them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It also has a strobe light and a whistle .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Also such location devices , some ships have smoke floats they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signals as a way of trying to , let the rescuer locate them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout the ship , all around the ship , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of the ship , not all around the entire ship , but on most parts there is a very thick netting .|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You will hear a P.A. announcement around the entire ship , there is a man overboard so everyone knows they have to react quickly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A ship - wide search will happen if they do n't see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship starts to circle that area continuously .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopters are launched immediately .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Inside those helicopters rescue swimmers .|||O O O O O O
If indeed the man overboard is located , well the hoister is dropped down with usually a torso harness .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
The search crews will go 24 hours before calling off that search .|||O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O
Why call it off ?|||O O O O O
There 's a number of reasons to look at .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Depending on the water temperature , it 's very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is they fail they 've exhausted all resources by that time .|||O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Professor Lee , I gather you know the man and know his work .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tell us a little bit about him , Who is he and why did he flee China .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-LOC O O
I would say that the great difference about Gao Xingjian is that he actually received a university education .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
He was educated in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that has influenced his own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse him of blind worship of Western models .|||O O O O B-LANGUAGE O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
Sartre is a big man in Mr. Xingjian 's life , is n't he ?|||B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
I would say so that Sartre has been a quite a big influence .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
I think the other influences would be Samuel Beckett , the Irish and French language writer , Unesco .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-LANGUAGE O B-LANGUAGE O O O B-PERSON O
These are models and , of course , all of these writers are writers who were active in the first half of the twentieth century .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Well , this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-GPE O B-EVENT O
He wrote a play , in particular about the events there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Would you say that his influences may be more French literary then they were his own immediate life experience ?|||O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
I would say both , in fact , because the first play that he wrote that made him famous was a play that dates from 1981 , which was actually called ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said or had resonances from Beckett 's play ` Waiting for Godot ' and it concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who were standing at a bus stop waiting for a bus that never came .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett , but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt , that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced , as he would wish , and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-FAC O B-DATE O

First up we have the answer to our geo quiz today .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
We are looking for a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O
The area is mostly mountainous and includes Mt. Corno , the highest peak of the Apennines .|||O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O B-LOC O
It also includes a lot of sheep , good clean - living , healthy sheep , and an Italian entrepreneur has an idea about how to make a little money of them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The answer is Abruzzo .|||O O O B-GPE O
Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome , Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo ?|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
So this guy came up with the idea of having people adopting sheep by an internet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So you can have access through your computer on your desk .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Go to the web site of these guys and you can have look at the face of sheep which are available to be adopted .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what does it mean to adopt a sheep , to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of its progress on the farm in Italy ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
You are not actually adopting the sheep in the sense that you can have it with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It works in the same way , so you have access on the web site of this little farm , in a little village of Abrutzi and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after contributing with a certain amount of money the sheep is actually yours .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All right , so the amount of money you have mentioned to us is about 160 US dollars and for that you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can also receive leggings that are made from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered to your door .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah , I mean this is quite funny , but apart from all the details , which are sometimes even strange I think what is really important is that it is a sign of a new concern that is effecting Italian people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
I mean we are notoriously lover of good food .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We have a generous attitude towards food , and this is a new stuff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fact that you really care about a sheep in the way she is fed , in the way she is nurtured , in the way people are looking after it , because it 's a way to ensure that you have something which is genuine on your table up the end .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wait a minute , you said that on your table at the end .|||O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah , at the table if it becomes food for instance , which is an option .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are adopting the sheep and whatever happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option is you know food for your meal .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That kind of puts a whole new tone to this thing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean usually when you think of this kind of adoption that means saving an animal not eventually eating it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean this is an option which is available and I think it is a sort of provocation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know Italians now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like Rome , Florence , Naples .|||O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O
In the past , we were a population of shepherds or farmers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had completely different attitude towards nature .|||O O O O O O O O
It seems that we are losing something , and we need to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that the Environment Minister in Italy supported the initiative and he himself adopted a sheep is significant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
He took advantage immediately of these ideas to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of Italians towards nature and farms .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O

When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after , US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague , but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia , those calls have grown quieter , according to Gary Bass , the author of the new book about war crimes trials , ` Stay , the Hand of Vengeance ' .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O
Even Madeleine Albright , who is with the President who is usually most decipherous about the importance of prosecuting war criminals , has in fact said that our first priority is making sure that Vojislov Kostunica can consolidate his democratic government and make that transition , and the issue of punishing war criminals sort of takes a back seat .|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

After all Bass points out , outside pressure has backfired in the past .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I , the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials , and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash .|||O B-GPE O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O B-NORP O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Little Oxford is very similar to the Taiwanese school being promoted by the TBAD .|||B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O B-ORG O
Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan 's elementary schools , and of the 15 or so teachers there , three are from Taiwan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-GPE O

According to Huang Su , executive director of Little Oxford , " A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children 's education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan , but I have to remind them that once you 've left in Taiwan , you 're not regular any longer .

According to Huang , making the school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
The key is to provide an education that meets the needs of the students .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O

The biggest story of the year in Taiwan has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- victory in the election on 18 March .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
Jin Zhong , president and editor - in - chief of Hong Kong 's OPEN magazine , which specializes in political reporting and commentary , spent an entire week in Taiwan observing the election campaign and its aftermath , and on 20 March , OPEN organized a seminar titled " The New President and Cross-Strait Relations .

The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than the DPP ticket , a margin of defeat which Jin Zhong described in his opening remarks as stunning .|||O B-ORG O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
When Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji made belligerent remarks a few days before the election in an effort to scare voters away from the DPP ticket , the ruling party made a grievous mistake , opined Jin , when it failed to come out strongly critical of Zhu and attempted instead to capitalize on the incident by playing the " fear card .

At the same time , however , winning candidate Chen Shui - bian captured only 39 % of the vote , which translates to a weak mandate .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result , he must take a moderate line that stresses inter-party cooperation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As for mainland China 's saber - rattling , Jin argued that there is no need for undue concern .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O

Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed by Ruan Ming , a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-NORP B-NORP O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O

" There 's nothing new in what they 're saying . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying , says Ruan , is that they will attack " if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence , " and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country 's name would be meaningless .|||O O O O B-NORP B-NORP O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The noted political commentator Chin Heng - wei , chief editor of Taiwan 's Contemporary Monthly , agreed strongly with Ruan 's comments , and added , " In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations .

Liao Tianding , Taiwan 's Robin Hood , fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in Pali , where he fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of his best friends .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-GPE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O B-GPE O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
Countless legends grew up around Liao after his death , and the people of Pali began to worship his spirit .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O

Pali was originally called Palifen , a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people .|||B-GPE O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O
Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan , Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest , rests against Mt.

Though it does n't have much of a hinterland , its geographic location has proved historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O
Later , when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan , they mainly settled along rivers .|||O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan 's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland .|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796 , Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui , located just across the river .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Once mainly dependent on fishing , Pali increasingly came to rely on farming .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the hardy people of Pali barely kept their stomachs filled , their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to this rural area .|||O O B-NORP O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-NORP O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
But in the 1970s , urban planning came to Pali .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-GPE O
It proved to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Changing the rhythm of Pali life|||O O O O B-GPE O
During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei , builders put up self - described " villas " and " mansions " -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Also , to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving , the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou .|||O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O B-GPE O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O B-GPE O
Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , Pali began to dream of a tourism boom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
But fortune had other things in store .|||O O O O O O O O
In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali , the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
The government , applying urban planning principles , zoned the area for residential and industrial use , in order to create a construction site for the facility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .|||O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
In accordance with the urban plan , new streets were cut this way and that through Pali 's land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 1997 , the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali .|||O B-DATE O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
This rural township , which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County , seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It 's certainly true that a lot of people here thought they would get rich from the rezoning .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But just because land increases in value does n't mean someone will buy it , and just because apartment complexes are built does n't mean there are people who want to live there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned in the struggle over divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money is involved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lin concludes : " I am not by any means opposed to development .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude ? "|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O

One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O
But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an " otherworldly " kind .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; consider specific proposals .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will differ in crucial ways .|||O O O O O O O
2 . `` Service '' should be service .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .|||O O O O O O O O
It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It follows that proposals like Nunn - McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $ 17,500 a year , do not qualify .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned , not given .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LAW I-LAW I-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs .|||O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why call that service ?|||O O O O O
3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Compelled service is unconstitutional .|||O O O O O
It is also unwise and unenforceable .|||O O O O O O O
-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB-|||O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . Good programs are not cheap .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought , housing rehabilitated , students tutored , day - care centers staffed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They involve stipends to participants .|||O O O O O O
Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-ORG O B-ORG O
Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY O O O
Are they worth that ?|||O O O O O
Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the calculations are challengeable .|||O O O O O O
5 . Underclass youth are a special concern .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ?|||O O O O O O O
Yes , if targeted .|||O O O O O
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle - class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities .|||O O O O O O O O
They are not enrolled in high school or college .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They are unlikely to be employed .|||O O O O O O O
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is a service to the nation .|||O O O O O O O O
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve .|||O O O O O O O O O O O

Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

With regard to Greece 's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self - confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
He has ample motive to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity .|||O O O B-ORG I-ORG O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 in bribes , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was from the $ 210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-PERSON O O

In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that point to PASOK , not clinching proof .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O
On another issue , Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members .|||O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O

So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Then , to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
Next , he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left - right coalition 's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well - respected Communist Party candidate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O
For balance , and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-PERSON O

As early as the first working discussion , at the end of August of last year , when the two associations implemented the " Wang - Gu Talks " , the Straits Association put forward in the " schedule for the discussion on implementing relevant agreements of the Wang - Gu Talks " that the associations should conduct specific discussions about " issues on strengthening tourism and contact on both sides " as soon as possible , but so far the Straits Foundation 's response has not been received .|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O

`` God 's kingdom is like a man who owned some land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O

`` About nine o'clock the man went to the marketplace and saw some other people standing there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were doing nothing .|||O O O O O
So he said to them , ' If you go and work in my field , I will pay you what your work is worth . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they went to work in the vineyard .|||O O O O O O O O O
`` The man went out again about twelve o'clock and again at three o'clock .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both times he hired some others to work in his vineyard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
About five o'clock the man went to the marketplace again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He saw some other people standing there .|||O O O O O O O O
He asked them , ' Why did you stand here all day doing nothing ? '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` They said , ' No one gave us a job . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` The man said to them , ' Then you can go and work in my vineyard . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

`` The workers who were hired at five o'clock came to get their pay .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Then the workers who were hired first came to get their pay .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They thought they would be paid more than the others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But each one of them also received one silver coin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
When they got their silver coin , they complained to the man who owned the land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , ' Those people were hired last and worked only one hour .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Jesus was going to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O
His twelve followers were with him .|||O O O O O O O
While they were walking , he gathered the followers together and spoke to them privately .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` We are going to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and the teachers of the law , and they will say he must die .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will hand him over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him and beat him with whips , and then they will kill him on a cross .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But on the third day after his death , he will be raised to life again . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Zebedee 's wife came to Jesus and brought her sons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
She bowed before Jesus and asked him to do something for her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` What do you want ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
She said , `` Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side in your kingdom and the other at your left . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Jesus said to the sons , `` You do n't understand what you are asking .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Can you drink from the cup that I must drink from ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sons answered , `` Yes , we can ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to them , `` It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My Father has decided who will do that .|||O O O O O O O O O
He has prepared those places for them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
The other ten followers heard this and were angry with the two brothers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Jesus called the followers together .|||O O O O O O O
He said , `` You know that the rulers of the non-Jewish people love to show their power over the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it should not be that way with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do as I did : The Son of Man did not come for people to serve him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho , a large crowd followed him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were two blind men sitting by the road .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They heard that Jesus was coming by .|||O O O O O O O O
So they shouted , `` Lord , Son of David , please help us ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people there criticized the blind men and told them to be quiet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they shouted more and more , `` Lord , Son of David , please help us ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus stopped and said to them , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They answered , `` Lord , we want to be able to see . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus felt sorry for the blind men .|||O O O O O O O O
He touched their eyes , and immediately they were able to see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they became followers of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O
Then Jesus left there and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Again , many people came to him , and Jesus taught them as he always did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to make him say something wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They asked him , `` Is it right for a man to divorce his wife ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` What did Moses command you to do ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Pharisees said , `` Moses allowed a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Moses wrote that command for you because you refused to accept God 's teaching .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But when God made the world , ' he made people male and female . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
' That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the two people will become one . '|||O O O O O O O O O
So they are no longer two , but one .|||O O O O O O O O O O
God has joined them together , so no one should separate them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Later , when the followers and Jesus were in the house , they asked him again about the question of divorce .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman has sinned against his wife .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is guilty of adultery .|||O O O O O O
And the woman who divorces her husband and marries another man is also guilty of adultery . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
People brought their small children to Jesus , so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the followers told the people to stop bringing their children to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus saw what happened .|||O O O O O
He did not like his followers telling the children not to come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he said to them , `` Let the little children come to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these little children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The truth is , you must accept God 's kingdom like a little child accepts things , or you will never enter it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus held the children in his arms .|||O O O O O O O O O
He laid his hands on them and blessed them .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus started to leave , but a man ran to him and bowed down on his knees before him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man asked , `` Good Teacher , what must I do to get the life that never ends ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` Why do you call me good ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Only God is good .|||O O O O O
And you know his commands : ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not lie , you must not cheat , you must respect your father and mother . . . . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man said , `` Teacher , I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus looked at the man in a way that showed how much he cared for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` There is still one thing you need to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Go and sell everything you have .|||O O O O O O O
Give the money to those who are poor , and you will have riches in heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then come and follow me . ''|||O O O O O O O
The man was upset when Jesus told him to give away his money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he went away sad .|||O O O O O O
Then Jesus looked at his followers and said to them , `` It will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers were amazed at what Jesus said .|||O O O O O O O O O
But he said again , `` My children , it is very hard to enter God 's kingdom !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers were even more amazed and said to each other , `` Then who can be saved ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus looked at them and said , `` That is something people can not do , but God can .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He can do anything . ''|||O O O O O O
Peter said to Jesus , `` We left everything to follow you ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` I can promise that everyone who has left their home , brothers , sisters , mother , father , children , or farm for me and for the Good News about me will get a hundred times more than they left .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here in this world they will get more homes , brothers , sisters , mothers , children , and farms .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And with these things they will have persecutions .|||O O O O O O O O O
But in the world that is coming they will also get the reward of eternal life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many people who have the highest place now will have the lowest place in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the people who have the lowest place now will have the highest place then . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus and those with him were on their way to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was at the front of the group .|||O O O O O O O O O
His followers were wondering what was happening , and the people who followed behind them were feeling afraid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus gathered the twelve apostles again and talked with them alone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told them what would happen in Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` We are going to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Son of Man will be handed over to the leading priests and teachers of the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will say that he must die and will hand him over to the foreigners , who will laugh at him and spit on him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will beat him with whips and kill him .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But on the third day after his death , he will rise to life again . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then James and John , sons of Zebedee , came to Jesus and said , `` Teacher , we want to ask you to do something for us . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus asked , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sons answered , `` Let us share the great honor you will have as king .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let one of us sit at your right side and the other at your left . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` You do n't understand what you are asking .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Can you drink from the cup that I must drink from ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Can you be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sons answered , `` Yes , we can ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to the sons , `` It is true that you will drink from the cup that I drink from .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you will be baptized with the same baptism that I must go through .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it is not for me to say who will sit at my right or my left .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God has prepared those places for the ones he chooses . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the other ten followers heard this , they were angry with James and John .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus called all the followers together .|||O O O O O O O
He said , `` The non-Jewish people have men they call rulers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know that those rulers love to show their power over the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And their important leaders love to use all their authority over the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it should not be that way with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever wants to be your leader must be your servant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever wants to be first must serve the rest of you like a slave .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Follow my example : Even the Son of Man did not come for people to serve him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He came to serve others and to give his life to save many people . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they came to the town of Jericho .|||O O O O O O O O O
When Jesus left there with his followers , a large crowd was with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A blind man named Bartimaeus -LRB- meaning `` son of Timaeus '' -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was sitting by the road .|||O O O O O O
He was always begging for money .|||O O O O O O O
He heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So he began shouting , `` Jesus , Son of David , please help me ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many people criticized the blind man and told him to be quiet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he shouted more and more , `` Son of David , please help me ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus stopped and said , `` Tell him to come here . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they called the blind man and said , `` You can be happy now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stand up !|||O O O
Jesus is calling you . ''|||O O O O O O
The blind man stood up quickly .|||O O O O O O O
He left his coat there and went to Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus asked the man , `` What do you want me to do for you ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` Teacher , I want to see again . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Go .|||O O O O O O
You are healed because you believed . ''|||O O O O O O O O
Immediately the man was able to see again .|||O O O O O O O O O
He followed Jesus down the road .|||O O O O O O O
After this , the Lord chose 72 more followers .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He sent them out in groups of two .|||O O O O O O O O O
He sent them ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` There is such a big harvest of people to bring in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But there are only a few workers to help harvest them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
God owns the harvest .|||O O O O O
Ask him to send more workers to help bring in his harvest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` You can go now .|||O O O O O O
But listen !|||O O O
I am sending you , and you will be like sheep among wolves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't carry any money , a bag , or sandals .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't stop to talk with people on the road .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Before you go into a house , say , ' Peace be with this home . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the people living there love peace , your blessing of peace will stay with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if not , your blessing of peace will come back to you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stay in the peace - loving house .|||O O O O O O O O
Eat and drink what the people there give you .|||O O O O O O O O O O
A worker should be given his pay .|||O O O O O O O O
Do n't leave that house to stay in another house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
`` If you go into a town and the people welcome you , eat the food they give you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heal the sick people who live there , and tell them , ' God 's kingdom is coming to you soon ! '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` But if you go into a town , and the people do n't welcome you , then go out into the streets of that town and say , ' Even the dirt from your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I tell you , on the judgment day it will be worse for the people of that town than for the people of Sodom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` It will be bad for you , Chorazin !|||O O O O O O O O O O
It will be bad for you , Bethsaida !|||O O O O O O O O O
I did many miracles in you .|||O O O O O O O
If those same miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon , then the people in those cities would have changed their lives and stopped sinning a long time ago .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They would have worn sackcloth and sat in ashes to show that they were sorry for their sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But on the judgment day it will be worse for you than for Tyre and Sidon .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to heaven ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , you will be thrown down to the place of death !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` When anyone listens to you my followers , they are really listening to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But when anyone refuses to accept you , they are really refusing to accept me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And when anyone refuses to accept me , they are refusing to accept the one who sent me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the 72 followers came back from their trip , they were very happy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Lord , even the demons obeyed us when we used your name ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to them , `` I saw Satan falling like lightning from the sky .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the enemy , but know that I have given you more power than he has .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have given you power to crush his snakes and scorpions under your feet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nothing will hurt you .|||O O O O O
Yes , even the spirits obey you .|||O O O O O O O O
And you can be happy , not because you have this power , but because your names are written in heaven . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the Holy Spirit made Jesus feel very happy .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` I praise you , Father , Lord of heaven and earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am thankful that you have hidden these things from those who are so wise and so smart .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you have shown them to people who are like little children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , Father , you did this because it 's what you really wanted to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` My Father has given me all things .|||O O O O O O O O O
No one knows who the Son is -- only the Father knows .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And only the Son knows who the Father is .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The only people who will know about the Father are those the Son chooses to tell . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus turned to his followers .|||O O O O O O O
They were there alone with him .|||O O O O O O O
He said , `` It is a great blessing for you to see what you now see !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I tell you , many prophets and kings wanted to see what you now see , but they could not .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they wanted to hear what you now hear , but they could not . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Teacher , what must I do to get eternal life ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to him , `` What is written in the law ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What do you understand from it ? ''|||O O O O O O O O
The man answered , `` ' Love the Lord your God with all your heart , all your soul , all your strength , and all your mind . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , ' Love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Your answer is right .|||O O O O O O O O O
Do this and you will have eternal life . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
But the man wanted to show that the way he was living was right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he said to Jesus , `` But who is my neighbor ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To answer this question , Jesus said , `` A man was going down the road from Jerusalem to Jericho .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some robbers surrounded him , tore off his clothes , and beat him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they left him lying there on the ground almost dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` It happened that a Jewish priest was going down that road .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When he saw the man , he did not stop to help him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He walked away .|||O O O O
Next , a Levite came near .|||O O O O O O O
He saw the hurt man , but he went around him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He would not stop to help him either .|||O O O O O O O O O
He just walked away .|||O O O O O
`` Then a Samaritan man traveled down that road .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He came to the place where the hurt man was lying .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He saw the man and felt very sorry for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The Samaritan went to him and poured olive oil and wine on his wounds .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he covered the man 's wounds with cloth .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Samaritan had a donkey .|||O O O O O O
He put the hurt man on his donkey , and he took him to an inn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There he cared for him .|||O O O O O O
The next day , the Samaritan took out two silver coins and gave them to the man who worked at the inn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , ' Take care of this hurt man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If you spend more money on him , I will pay it back to you when I come again . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said , `` Which one of these three men do you think was really a neighbor to the man who was hurt by the robbers ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The teacher of the law answered , `` The one who helped him . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Then you go and do the same . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While Jesus and his followers were traveling , he went into a town , and a woman named Martha let him stay at her house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She had a sister named Mary .|||O O O O O O O
Mary was sitting at Jesus ' feet and listening to him teach .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But her sister Martha was busy doing all the work that had to be done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Martha went in and said , `` Lord , do n't you care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tell her to help me ! ''|||O O O O O O O
But the Lord answered her , `` Martha , Martha , you are getting worried and upset about too many things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only one thing is important .|||O O O O O O
Mary has made the right choice , and it will never be taken away from her . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One day Jesus was in the Temple area teaching the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was telling them the Good News .|||O O O O O O O O
The leading priests , teachers of the law , and older Jewish leaders came to talk to Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Tell us what authority you have to do these things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Who gave you this authority ? ''|||O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` I will ask you a question too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tell me : When John baptized people , did his authority come from God or was it only from other people ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The priests , the teachers of the law , and the Jewish leaders all talked about this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said to each other , `` If we answer , ' John 's baptism was from God , ' then he will say , ' Then why did you not believe John ? '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if we say that John 's baptism was from someone else , the people will stone us to death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all believe that John was a prophet . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
So they answered , `` We do n't know the answer . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Jesus said to them , `` Then I will not tell you who gave me the authority to do these things . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus told the people this story : `` A man planted a vineyard .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He leased the land to some farmers .|||O O O O O O O O
Then he went away for a long time .|||O O O O O O O O O
Later , it was time for the grapes to be picked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the man sent a servant to those farmers so that they would give him his share of the grapes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they beat the servant and sent him away with nothing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the man sent another servant .|||O O O O O O O
They beat this servant too and showed no respect for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They sent the servant away with nothing .|||O O O O O O O O
So the man sent a third servant to the farmers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They hurt this servant badly and threw him out .|||O O O O O O O O O O
`` The owner of the vineyard said , ' What will I do now ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will send my son .|||O O O O O O
I love my son very much .|||O O O O O O O
Maybe the farmers will respect my son . '|||O O O O O O O O O
When the farmers saw the son , they said to each other , ' This is the owner 's son .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This vineyard will be his .|||O O O O O O
If we kill him , it will be ours . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So the farmers threw the son out of the vineyard and killed him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` What will the owner of the vineyard do ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
He will come and kill those farmers .|||O O O O O O O O
Then he will lease the land to some other farmers . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the people heard this story , they said , `` This should never happen ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus looked into their eyes and said , `` Then what does this verse mean : ' The stone that the builders refused to accept became the cornerstone ' ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken .|||O O O O O O O O O O
If that stone falls on you , it will crush you ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the teachers of the law and the leading priests heard this story , they knew it was about them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they wanted to arrest Jesus right then , but they were afraid of what the people would do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the Jewish leaders waited for the right time to get Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They sent some men to him , who pretended to be sincere .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They wanted to find something wrong with what Jesus said .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- If they found something wrong , then they could hand him over to the governor , who had the authority to arrest him . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the men said to Jesus , `` Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is true .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It does n't matter who is listening -- you teach the same to all people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You always teach the truth about God 's way .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Tell us , is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus knew that these men were trying to trick him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` Show me a silver coin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whose name and picture are on it ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Caesar 's . ''|||O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar , and give to God what belongs to God . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The men were amazed at his wise answer .|||O O O O O O O O O
They could say nothing .|||O O O O O
They were not able to trick Jesus there in front of the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said nothing they could use against him .|||O O O O O O O O O
Some Sadducees came to Jesus .|||O O O O O O
-LRB- Sadducees believe that people will not rise from death . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They asked him , `` Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and had no children , his brother must marry his widow .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they will have children for the dead brother .|||O O O O O O O O O O
One time there were seven brothers .|||O O O O O O O
The first brother married a woman but died .|||O O O O O O O O O
He had no children .|||O O O O O
Then the second brother married the woman , and he died .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the third brother married the woman , and he died .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The same thing happened with all the other brothers .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They all died and had no children .|||O O O O O O O O
The woman was the last to die .|||O O O O O O O O
But all seven brothers married her .|||O O O O O O O
So when people rise from death , whose wife will this woman be ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to the Sadducees , `` On earth , people marry each other .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some people will be worthy to be raised from death and live again after this life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In that life they will not marry .|||O O O O O O O O
In that life people are like angels and can not die .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are children of God , because they have been raised from death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moses clearly showed that people are raised from death .|||O O O O O O O O O O
When Moses wrote about the burning bush , he said that the Lord is ' the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they were not still dead , because he is the God only of living people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , to God they are all still living . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the teachers of the law said , `` Teacher , your answer was very good . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No one was brave enough to ask him another question .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said , `` Why do people say that the Christ is the Son of David ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the book of Psalms , David himself says , ' The Lord God said to my Lord : Sit by me at my right side , and I will put your enemies under your power . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
David calls the Christ ' Lord . '|||O O O O O O O O
So how can the Christ also be David 's son ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
While all the people were listening to Jesus , he said to his followers , `` Be careful of the teachers of the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They like to walk around wearing clothes that look important .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And they love for people to show respect to them in the marketplaces .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they cheat widows and take their homes .|||O O O O O O O O O
Then they try to make themselves look good by saying long prayers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God will punish them very much . ''|||O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` It is certainly true that when a man enters the sheep pen , he should use the gate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If he climbs in some other way , he is a robber .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is trying to steal the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O
But the man who takes care of the sheep enters through the gate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the shepherd .|||O O O O O
The man who guards the gate opens the gate for the shepherd .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the sheep listen to the voice of the shepherd .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He calls his own sheep , using their names , and he leads them out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He brings all of his sheep out .|||O O O O O O O O
Then he goes ahead of them and leads them .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The sheep follow him , because they know his voice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But sheep will never follow someone they do n't know .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They will run away from him , because they do n't know his voice . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus told the people this story , but they did not understand what it meant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Jesus said again , `` I assure you , I am the gate for the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All those who came before me were thieves and robbers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The sheep did not listen to them .|||O O O O O O O O
I am the gate .|||O O O O O
Whoever enters through me will be saved .|||O O O O O O O O
They will be able to come in and go out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They will find everything they need .|||O O O O O O O
A thief comes to steal , kill , and destroy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But I came to give life -- life that is full and good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` I am the good shepherd , and the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The worker who is paid to keep the sheep is different from the shepherd .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The paid worker does not own the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O
So when he sees a wolf coming , he runs away and leaves the sheep alone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The man runs away because he is only a paid worker .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He does not really care for the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O
`` I am the shepherd who cares for the sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I know my sheep just as the Father knows me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And my sheep know me just as I know the Father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I give my life for these sheep .|||O O O O O O O O
I have other sheep too .|||O O O O O O
They are not in this flock here .|||O O O O O O O O
I must lead them also .|||O O O O O O
They will listen to my voice .|||O O O O O O O
In the future there will be one flock and one shepherd .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Father loves me because I give my life .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I give my life so that I can get it back again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No one takes my life away from me .|||O O O O O O O O O
I give my own life freely .|||O O O O O O O
I have the right to give my life , and I have the right to get it back again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is what the Father told me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Again the Jews were divided over what Jesus was saying .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Many of them said , `` A demon has come into him and made him crazy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why listen to him ? ''|||O O O O O O
But others said , `` These are n't the words of someone controlled by a demon .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A demon can not heal the eyes of a blind man . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was winter , and the time came for the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus was in the Temple area at Solomon 's Porch .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish leaders gathered around him .|||O O O O O O O
They said , `` How long will you make us wonder about you ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you are the Christ , then tell us clearly . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` I told you already , but you did not believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do miracles in my Father 's name .|||O O O O O O O O O
These miracles show who I am .|||O O O O O O O
But you do not believe , because you are not my sheep .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My sheep listen to my voice .|||O O O O O O O
I know them , and they follow me .|||O O O O O O O O O
I give my sheep eternal life .|||O O O O O O O
They will never die , and no one can take them out of my hand .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My Father is the one who gave them to me , and he is greater than all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No one can steal my sheep out of his hand .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The Father and I are one . ''|||O O O O O O O O
Again the Jews there picked up stones to kill Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But he said to them , `` The many wonderful things you have seen me do are from the Father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Which of these good things are you killing me for ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They answered , `` We are not killing you for any good thing you did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you say things that insult God .|||O O O O O O O O
You are only a man , but you say you are the same as God !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is why we are trying to kill you ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` It is written in your law that God said , ' I said you are gods . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This Scripture called those people gods -- the people who received God 's message .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And Scripture is always true .|||O O O O O O
So why do you accuse me of insulting God for saying , ' I am God 's Son ' ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am the one God chose and sent into the world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
If I do n't do what my Father does , then do n't believe what I say .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if I do what my Father does , you should believe in what I do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You might not believe in me , but you should believe in the things I do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They tried to get Jesus again , but he escaped from them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John began his work of baptizing people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus stayed there , and many people came to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` John never did any miraculous signs , but everything John said about this man is true . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And many people there believed in Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O
Early on Sunday morning , while it was still dark , Mary Magdalene went to the tomb .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She saw that the large stone was moved away from the entrance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So she ran to Simon Peter and the other follower -LRB- the one Jesus loved very much -RRB- .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She said , `` They have taken the Lord out of the tomb , and we do n't know where they put him . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Peter and the other follower started going to the tomb .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were both running , but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He bent down and looked in .|||O O O O O O O
He saw the pieces of linen cloth lying there , but he did not go in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Simon Peter finally reached the tomb and went in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He saw the pieces of linen lying there .|||O O O O O O O O O
He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus ' head .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was folded up and laid in a different place from the pieces of linen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the other follower went in -- the one who had reached the tomb first .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He saw what had happened and believed .|||O O O O O O O O
-LRB- These followers did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from death . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the followers went back home .|||O O O O O O O
But Mary stood outside the tomb , crying .|||O O O O O O O O O
While she was crying , she bent down and looked inside the tomb .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She saw two angels dressed in white sitting where Jesus ' body had been .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One was sitting where the head had been ; the other was sitting where the feet had been .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angels asked Mary , `` Woman , why are you crying ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mary answered , `` They took away the body of my Lord , and I do n't know where they put him . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Mary said this , she turned around and saw Jesus standing there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But she did not know that it was Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He asked her , `` Woman , why are you crying ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Who are you looking for ? ''|||O O O O O O O
She thought that this was the man who takes care of the garden .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So she said to him , `` Did you take him away , sir ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tell me where you put him .|||O O O O O O O
I will go and get him . ''|||O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to her , `` Mary . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
She turned toward him and said in Aramaic , `` Rabboni , '' which means `` Teacher . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to her , `` You do n't need to hold on to me !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have not yet gone back up to the Father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But go to my followers and tell them this : ' I am going back to my Father and your Father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am going back to my God and your God . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mary Magdalene went to the followers and told them , `` I saw the Lord ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And she told them what he had said to her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The day was Sunday , and that same evening the followers were together .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They had the doors locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Suddenly , Jesus was standing there among them .|||O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Peace be with you ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
As soon as he said this , he showed them his hands and his side .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the followers saw the Lord , they were very happy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said again , `` Peace be with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It was the Father who sent me , and I am now sending you in the same way . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he breathed on them and said , `` Receive the Holy Spirit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you forgive the sins of anyone , their sins are forgiven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If there is anyone whose sins you do n't forgive , their sins are not forgiven . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thomas -LRB- called Didymus -RRB- was one of the twelve , but he was not with the other followers when Jesus came .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told him , `` We saw the Lord . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Thomas said , `` That 's hard to believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I will have to see the nail holes in his hands , put my finger where the nails were , and put my hand into his side .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only then will I believe it . ''|||O O O O O O O O
A week later the followers were in the house again , and Thomas was with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The doors were locked , but Jesus came and stood among them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Peace be with you ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then he said to Thomas , `` Put your finger here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Look at my hands .|||O O O O O
Put your hand here in my side .|||O O O O O O O O
Stop doubting and believe . ''|||O O O O O O
Thomas said to Jesus , `` My Lord and my God ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to him , `` You believe because you see me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great blessings belong to the people who believe without seeing me ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus did many other miraculous signs that his followers saw , which are not written in this book .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But these are written so that you can believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then , by believing , you can have life through his name .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the city of Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a Roman army officer in what was called the Italian Unit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was a religious man .|||O O O O O O
He and all the others who lived in his house were worshipers of the true God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He gave much of his money to help the poor people and always prayed to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One afternoon about three o'clock , Cornelius had a vision .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He clearly saw an angel from God coming to him and saying , `` Cornelius ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Staring at the angel and feeling afraid , Cornelius said , `` What do you want , sir ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel said to him , `` God has heard your prayers and has seen your gifts to the poor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He remembers you and all you have done .|||O O O O O O O O O
Send some men now to the city of Joppa to get a man named Simon , who is also called Peter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is staying with someone also named Simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel who spoke to Cornelius left .|||O O O O O O O O
Then Cornelius called two of his servants and a soldier .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The soldier was a religious man , one of his close helpers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cornelius explained everything to these three men and sent them to Joppa .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The next day they were coming near Joppa about noon , when Peter was going up to the roof to pray .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was hungry and wanted to eat .|||O O O O O O O O
But while they were preparing the food for Peter to eat , he had a vision .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He saw something coming down through the open sky .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It looked like a big sheet being lowered to the ground by its four corners .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In it were all kinds of animals , reptiles , and birds .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then a voice said to him , `` Get up , Peter ; kill anything here and eat it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Peter said , `` I ca n't do that , Lord !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have never eaten anything that is not pure or fit to be used for food . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the voice said to him again , `` God has made these things pure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't say they are unfit to eat . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
This happened three times .|||O O O O O
Then the whole thing was taken back up into heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter wondered what this vision meant .|||O O O O O O O
The men Cornelius sent had found Simon 's house .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They were standing at the door .|||O O O O O O O
They asked , `` Is Simon Peter staying here ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
While Peter was still thinking about the vision , the Spirit said to him , `` Listen , three men are looking for you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Get up and go downstairs .|||O O O O O O
Go with these men without wondering if it 's all right , because I sent them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Peter went downstairs and said to them , `` I think I 'm the man you are looking for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why did you come here ? ''|||O O O O O O O
The men said , `` A holy angel told Cornelius to invite you to his house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is an army officer .|||O O O O O O
He is a good man , one who worships God , and all the Jewish people respect him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel told him to invite you to his house so that he can listen to what you have to say . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter asked the men to come in and stay for the night .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The next day Peter got ready and went away with the three men .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the believers from Joppa went with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The next day they came to the city of Caesarea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Cornelius was waiting for them and had already gathered his relatives and close friends at his house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Peter entered the house , Cornelius met him .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He fell down at Peter 's feet and worshiped him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But Peter told him to get up .|||O O O O O O O O
Peter said , `` Stand up !|||O O O O O O O
I am only a man like you . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Peter continued talking with Cornelius .|||O O O O O O
Then Peter went inside and saw a large group of people gathered there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter said to the people , `` You understand that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit anyone who is not a Jew .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But God has shown me that I should not consider anyone unfit or say they are not pure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's why I did n't argue when your men asked me to come here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now , please tell me why you sent for me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cornelius said , `` Four days ago , I was praying in my house .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was at this same time -- three o'clock in the afternoon .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Suddenly there was someone standing before me wearing bright , shiny clothes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , ' Cornelius , God has heard your prayer and has seen your gifts to the poor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He remembers you and all you have done .|||O O O O O O O O O
So send some men to the city of Joppa and tell Simon Peter to come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is staying with another man named Simon , a leatherworker who has a house beside the sea . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I sent for you immediately .|||O O O O O O O
It was very good of you to come here .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Now we are all here before God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter began to speak : `` I really understand now that God does not consider some people to be better than others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is not important what nation they come from .|||O O O O O O O O O O
God has spoken to the people of Israel .|||O O O O O O O O O
He sent them the Good News that peace has come through Jesus Christ , the Lord of all people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` You know what has happened all over Judea .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It began in Galilee after John told the people they needed to be baptized .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know about Jesus from Nazareth .|||O O O O O O O
God made him the Christ by giving him the Holy Spirit and power .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus went everywhere doing good for people .|||O O O O O O O O
He healed those who were ruled by the devil , showing that God was with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` We saw all that Jesus did in Judea and in Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he was killed .|||O O O O O
They put him on a cross made of wood .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But on the third day after his death , God raised him to life and let him be seen openly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was not seen by everyone , but only by us , the ones God had already chosen to be witnesses .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ate and drank with him after he was raised from death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` Jesus told us to go and speak to the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told us to tell them that he is the one God chose to be the Judge of all who are living and all who have died .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone who believes in Jesus will have their sins forgiven through his name .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the prophets agree that this is true . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
While Peter was still speaking these words , the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening to his speech .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the Holy Spirit had been poured out as a gift also to people who were not Jews .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They heard them speaking different languages and praising God .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then Peter said , `` How can anyone object to these people being baptized in water ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have received the Holy Spirit the same as we did ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Peter told them to baptize Cornelius and his relatives and friends in the name of Jesus Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the trouble stopped , Paul invited the Lord 's followers to come visit him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After encouraging them , he told them goodbye and left for Macedonia .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On his way through Macedonia he had many words of encouragement for the followers in various places .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he went to Greece and stayed there three months .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul was ready to sail for Syria , but some Jews were planning something against him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he decided to go back through Macedonia to Syria .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
These men were traveling with him : Sopater , the son of Pyrrhus , from the city of Berea ; Aristarchus and Secundus , from the city of Thessalonica ; Gaius , from the city of Derbe ; Timothy ; and two men from Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These men went first , ahead of Paul .|||O O O O O O O O O
They waited for us in the city of Troas .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We sailed from the city of Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We met these men in Troas five days later and stayed there seven days .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On Sunday we all met together to eat the Lord 's Supper .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul talked to the group .|||O O O O O O
Because he was planning to leave the next day , he continued talking until midnight .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were all together in a room upstairs , and there were many lights in the room .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a young man named Eutychus sitting in the window .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul continued talking , and Eutychus became very , very sleepy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , he went to sleep and fell out of the window .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He fell to the ground from the third floor .|||O O O O O O O O O O
When the people went down and lifted him up , he was dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul went down to where Eutychus was , knelt down beside him , and put his arms around him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to the other believers , `` Do n't worry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is alive now . ''|||O O O O O O
Then Paul went upstairs again , broke off some pieces of bread and ate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He spoke to them a long time .|||O O O O O O O O
It was early morning when he finished , and then he left .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Lord 's followers took Eutychus home alive , and they were all greatly comforted .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We went on ahead of Paul and sailed for the city of Assos , planning to meet him there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is what he told us to do because he wanted to go by land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When he caught up with us at Assos , we took him on board , and we all sailed to Mitylene .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The next day , we sailed away from there and came to a place near the island of Chios .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the next day , we sailed to the island of Samos .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A day later , we came to the city of Miletus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul had already decided not to stop at Ephesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He did not want to stay too long in Asia .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He was hurrying because he wanted to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost if possible .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Miletus Paul sent a message back to Ephesus , telling the elders of the church in Ephesus to come to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When they came , Paul said to them , `` You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know the way I lived all the time I was with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Jews planned things against me , and this gave me much trouble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you know that I always served the Lord , sometimes with tears .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I never thought about myself first .|||O O O O O O O
I always did what was best for you .|||O O O O O O O O O
I told you the Good News about Jesus in public before the people and also taught in your homes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I told everyone -- Jewish and non-Jewish people -- to change and turn to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I told them all to believe in our Lord Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
`` But now I must obey the Spirit and go to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know what will happen to me there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't care about my own life .|||O O O O O O O O O
The most important thing is that I finish my work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I want to finish the work that the Lord Jesus gave me to do -- to tell people the Good News about God 's grace .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` And now listen to me .|||O O O O O O O
I know that none of you will ever see me again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the time I was with you , I told you the Good News about God 's kingdom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So today I can tell you one thing that I am sure of : God will not blame me if some of you are not saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I can say this because I know that I told you everything that God wants you to know .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Be careful for yourselves and for all the people God has given you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Holy Spirit gave you the work of caring for this flock .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must be like shepherds to the church of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the church that God bought with his own blood .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know that after I leave , some men will come into your group .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will be like wild wolves and will try to destroy the flock .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , men from your own group will begin to teach things that are wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will lead some of the Lord 's followers away from the truth to follow them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So be careful !|||O O O O
And always remember what I did during the three years I was with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I never stopped reminding each one of you how you should live , counseling you day and night and crying over you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` Now I am putting you in God 's care .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I am depending on the message about his grace to make you strong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That message is able to give you the blessings that God gives to all his holy people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When I was with you , I never wanted anyone 's money or fine clothes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know that I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of the people who were with me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I always showed you that you should work just as I did and help people who are weak .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I taught you to remember the words of the Lord Jesus : ' You will have a greater blessing when you give than when you receive . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Paul finished speaking , he knelt down , and they all prayed together .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They cried and cried .|||O O O O O
They were especially sad because Paul had said they would never see him again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They hugged him and kissed him .|||O O O O O O O
Then they went with him to the ship to say goodbye .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brothers and sisters , what I want most is for all the people of Israel to be saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is my prayer to God .|||O O O O O O O
I can say this about them : They really try hard to follow God , but they do n't know the right way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not know the way that God makes people right with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they tried to make themselves right in their own way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they did not accept God 's way of making people right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him is made right with God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moses writes about being made right by following the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He says , `` The person who obeys these laws is the one who will have life through them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But this is what the Scriptures say about being made right through faith : `` Do n't say to yourself , ' Who will go up into heaven ? ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- This means `` Who will go up to heaven to get Christ and bring him down to earth ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-RRB- `` And do n't say , ' Who will go down into the world below ? ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- This means `` Who will go down to get Christ and bring him up from death ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-RRB- This is what the Scripture says : `` God 's teaching is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is the teaching of faith that we tell people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If you openly say , `` Jesus is Lord '' and believe in your heart that God raised him from death , you will be saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , we believe in Jesus deep in our hearts , and so we are made right with God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we openly say that we believe in him , and so we are saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , the Scriptures say , `` Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It says this because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The same Lord is the Lord of all people .|||O O O O O O O O O O
And he richly blesses everyone who looks to him for help .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , `` everyone who trusts in the Lord will be saved . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But before people can pray to the Lord for help , they must believe in him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And before they can believe in the Lord , they must hear about him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And for anyone to hear about the Lord , someone must tell them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And before anyone can go and tell them , they must be sent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the Scriptures say , `` How wonderful it is to see someone coming to tell good news ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But not all the people accepted that good news .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Isaiah said , `` Lord , who believed what we told them ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So faith comes from hearing the Good News .|||O O O O O O O O O
And people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I ask , `` Did those people not hear the Good News ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , they heard -- as the Scriptures say , `` Their voices went out all around the world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their words went everywhere in the world . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Again I ask , `` Did the people of Israel not understand ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , they did understand .|||O O O O O O
First , Moses says this for God : `` I will use those who are not really a nation to make you jealous .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Isaiah is bold enough to say this for God : `` The people who were not looking for me -- they are the ones who found me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I made myself known to those who did not ask for me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But about the people of Israel God says , `` All day long I stood ready to accept those people , but they are stubborn and refuse to obey me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brothers and sisters , I want you to know what happened to our ancestors who were with Moses .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were all under the cloud , and they all walked through the sea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all ate the same spiritual food , and they all drank the same spiritual drink .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They drank from that spiritual rock that was with them , and that rock was Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But God was not pleased with most of those people , so they were killed in the desert .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And these things that happened are examples for us .|||O O O O O O O O O O
These examples should stop us from wanting evil things like those people did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't worship idols as some of them did .|||O O O O O O O O O O
As the Scriptures say , `` The people sat down to eat and drink and then got up to have a wild party . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We should not commit sexual sins as some of them did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
In one day 23 , 000 of them died because of their sin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We should not test Christ as some of them did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of that , they were killed by snakes .|||O O O O O O O O O O
And do n't complain as some of them did .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Because they complained , they were killed by the angel that destroys .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The things that happened to those people are examples .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They were written to be warnings for us .|||O O O O O O O O O
We live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So anyone who thinks they are standing strong should be careful that they do n't fall .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only temptations that you have are the same temptations that all people have .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you can trust God .|||O O O O O O
He will not let you be tempted more than you can bear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But when you are tempted , God will also give you a way to escape that temptation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then you will be able to endure it .|||O O O O O O O O O
So , my dear friends , stay away from worshiping idols .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are intelligent people .|||O O O O O
Judge for yourselves the truth of what I say now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The cup of blessing that we give thanks for is a sharing in the blood sacrifice of Christ , is n't it ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ , is n't it ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is one loaf of bread , so we who are many are one body , because we all share in that one loaf .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And think about what the people of Israel do .|||O O O O O O O O O O
When they eat the sacrifices , they are united by sharing what was offered on the altar .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , am I saying that sacrifices to idols are the same as those Jewish sacrifices ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , because an idol is nothing , and the things offered to idols are worth nothing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I am saying that when food is sacrificed to idols , it is an offering to demons , not to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I do n't want you to share anything with demons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can not drink the cup of the Lord and then go drink a cup that honors demons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can not share a meal at the Lord 's table and then go share a meal that honors demons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doing that would make the Lord jealous .|||O O O O O O O O
Do you really want to do that ?|||O O O O O O O O
Do you think we are stronger than he is ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
`` All things are allowed , '' you say .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But not all things are good .|||O O O O O O O
`` All things are allowed . ''|||O O O O O O O
But some things do n't help anyone .|||O O O O O O O O
Try to do what is good for others , not just what is good for yourselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't ask questions about it to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can eat it , `` because the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Someone who is not a believer might invite you to eat with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you want to go , then eat anything that is put before you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't ask questions to see if it is something you think is wrong to eat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if someone tells you , `` That food was offered to idols , '' then do n't eat it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's because some people think it is wrong , and it might cause a problem for the person who told you that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't mean that you think it is wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the other person might think it is wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O
That 's the only reason not to eat it .|||O O O O O O O O O O
My own freedom should not be judged by what another person thinks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I eat the meal with thankfulness .|||O O O O O O O
So I do n't want to be criticized because of something I thank God for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So if you eat , or if you drink , or if you do anything , do it for the glory of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Never do anything that might make other people do wrong -- Jews , non-Jews , or anyone in God 's church .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do the same thing .|||O O O O O O
I try to please everyone in every way .|||O O O O O O O O O
I am not trying to do what is good for me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am trying to do what is good for the most people so that they can be saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I , Paul , am begging you with the gentleness and the kindness of Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some say that I am bold when I am writing you from a distance , but not when I am there with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They think our motives for what we do are like those of the world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I plan to be very bold against those people when I come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I hope I will not need to use that same boldness with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We live in this world , but we do n't fight our battles in the same way the world does .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The weapons we use are not human ones .|||O O O O O O O O O
Our weapons have power from God and can destroy the enemy 's strong places .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We destroy people 's arguments , and we tear down every proud idea that raises itself against the knowledge of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey , but first we want you to be fully obedient .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must look at the facts before you .|||O O O O O O O O O
If you feel sure you belong to Christ , you must remember that we belong to Christ the same as you do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It may seem as though we boast too much about the authority the Lord gave us .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he gave us this authority to strengthen you , not to hurt you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I will not be ashamed of whatever boasting we do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't want you to think that I am trying to scare you with my letters .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some people say , `` Paul 's letters are powerful and sound important , but when he is with us , he is weak and the worst speaker you have ever heard . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Those people should know this : When we are there with you , we will show the same power that we show now in our letters .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't dare put ourselves in the same class with those who think they are so important .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't compare ourselves to them .|||O O O O O O O O
They use themselves to measure themselves , and they judge themselves by what they themselves are .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This shows that they know nothing .|||O O O O O O O
But we will not boast about anything outside the work that was given us to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We will limit our boasting to the work God gave us , but this work includes our work with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We would be boasting too much only if we had not already come to you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We limit our boasting to the work that is ours .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't boast about the work other people have done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hope that your faith will continue to grow .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We hope that you will help our work to grow much larger .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't want to boast about work that has already been done in someone else 's area .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` Whoever boasts should boast only about the Lord . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
What people say about themselves means nothing .|||O O O O O O O O
What counts is whether or not the Lord says they have done well .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The law gave us only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The law is not a perfect picture of the real things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The law tells people to offer the same sacrifices every year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Those who come to worship God continue to offer those sacrifices .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the law can never make them perfect .|||O O O O O O O O O
If the law could make people perfect , those sacrifices would have already stopped .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They would already be clean from their sins , and they would not still feel guilty .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But that 's not what happens .|||O O O O O O O
Their sacrifices make them remember their sins every year , because it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So when Christ came into the world he said , `` You do n't want sacrifices and offerings , but you have prepared a body for me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are not pleased with the sacrifices of animals killed and burned or with offerings to take away sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I said , ' Here I am , God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is written about me in the book of the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have come to do what you want . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ first said , `` You do n't want sacrifices and offerings .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are not pleased with animals killed and burned or with sacrifices to take away sin . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- These are all sacrifices that the law commands . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he said , `` Here I am , God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I have come to do what you want . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
So God ends that first system of sacrifices and starts his new way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus Christ did the things God wanted him to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And because of that , we are made holy through the sacrifice of Christ 's body .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ made that sacrifice one time -- enough for all time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Every day the priests stand and do their religious service .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Again and again they offer the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Christ offered only one sacrifice for sins , and that sacrifice is good for all time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he sat down at the right side of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With one sacrifice Christ made his people perfect forever .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They are the ones who are being made holy .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Holy Spirit also tells us about this .|||O O O O O O O O O
First he says , `` This is the agreement I will make with my people in the future , says the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will put my laws in their hearts .|||O O O O O O O O O
I will write my laws in their minds . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then he says , `` I will forget their sins and never again remember the evil they have done . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And after everything is forgiven , there is no more need for a sacrifice to pay for sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And so , brothers and sisters , we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We can do this without fear because of the blood sacrifice of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We enter through a new way that Jesus opened for us .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is a living way that leads through the curtain -- Christ 's body .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we have a great priest who rules the house of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sprinkled with the blood of Christ , our hearts have been made free from a guilty conscience , and our bodies have been washed with pure water .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So come near to God with a sincere heart , full of confidence because of our faith in Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We must hold on to the hope we have , never hesitating to tell people about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We can trust God to do what he promised .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We should think about each other to see how we can encourage each other to show love and do good works .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We must not quit meeting together , as some are doing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , we need to keep on encouraging each other .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This becomes more and more important as you see the Day getting closer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If we decide to continue sinning after we have learned the truth , then there is no other sacrifice that will take away sins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If we continue sinning , all that is left for us is a fearful time of waiting for the judgment and the angry fire that will destroy those who live against God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever refused to obey the Law of Moses was found guilty from the testimony given by two or three witnesses .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such people were not forgiven .|||O O O O O O
They were killed .|||O O O O
So think how much more punishment people deserve who show their hate for the Son of God -- people who show they have no respect for the blood sacrifice that began the new agreement and once made them holy or who insult the Spirit of God 's grace .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We know that God said , `` I will punish people for the wrongs they do ; I will repay them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he also said , `` The Lord will judge his people . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is a terrible thing to face punishment from the living God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Remember the days when you first learned the truth .|||O O O O O O O O O O
You had a hard struggle with much suffering , but you continued strong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sometimes people said hateful things to you and mistreated you in public .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And sometimes you helped others who were being treated that same way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , you helped them in prison and shared in their suffering .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you were still happy when everything you owned was taken away from you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You continued to be happy , because you knew that you had something much better -- something that would continue forever .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So do n't lose the courage that you had in the past .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Your courage will be rewarded richly .|||O O O O O O O
You must be patient .|||O O O O O
After you have done what God wants , you will get what he promised you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He says , `` Very soon now , the one who is coming will come and will not be late .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The person who is right with me will live by trusting in me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I will not be pleased with the one who turns back in fear . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we are not those who turn back and are lost .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
No , we are the people who have faith and are saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel was dressed in a cloud .|||O O O O O O O O
He had a rainbow around his head .|||O O O O O O O O
The angel 's face was like the sun , and his legs were like poles of fire .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel was holding a small scroll .|||O O O O O O O O
The scroll was open in his hand .|||O O O O O O O O
He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion .|||O O O O O O O O O O
After he shouted , the voices of seven thunders spoke .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The seven thunders spoke , and I started to write .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But then I heard a voice from heaven that said , `` Do n't write what the seven thunders said .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Keep those things secret . ''|||O O O O O O
Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel made a promise by the power of the one who lives forever and ever .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the one who made the skies and all that is in them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He made the earth and all that is in it , and he made the sea and all that is in it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel said , `` There will be no more waiting !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet , God 's secret plan will be completed -- the Good News that God told to his servants , the prophets . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I heard the same voice from heaven again .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It said to me , `` Go and take the open scroll that is in the angel 's hand .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to me , `` Take the scroll and eat it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It will be sour in your stomach , but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I took the little scroll from the angel 's hand and ate it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In my mouth it tasted sweet like honey , but after I ate it , it was sour in my stomach .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I was told , `` You must prophesy again about many races of people , many nations , languages , and rulers . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I saw an angel coming down out of heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The angel had the key to the bottomless pit .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The angel also held a large chain in his hand .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel grabbed the dragon , that old snake , also known as the devil or Satan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel tied the dragon with the chain for 1000 years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the angel threw the dragon into the bottomless pit and closed it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angel locked it over the dragon .|||O O O O O O O O
The angel did this so that the dragon could not trick the people of the earth until the 1000 years were ended .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 1000 years the dragon must be made free for a short time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
These were the ones who had been given the power to judge .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the truth of Jesus and the message from God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not worship the beast or its idol .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They did not receive the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They came back to life and ruled with Christ for 1000 years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- The rest of the dead did not live again until the 1000 years were ended . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first resurrection .|||O O O O O O
Great blessings belong to those who share in this first resurrection .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are God 's holy people .|||O O O O O O O
The second death has no power over them .|||O O O O O O O O O
They will be priests for God and for Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They will rule with him for 1000 years .|||O O O O O O O O O
When the 1000 years are ended , Satan will be made free from his prison .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He will go out to trick the nations in all the earth , the nations known as Gog and Magog .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Satan will gather the people for battle .|||O O O O O O O O
There will be more people than anyone can count , like sand on the seashore .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I saw Satan 's army march across the earth and gather around the camp of God 's people and the city that God loves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But fire came down from heaven and destroyed Satan 's army .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he -LRB- the one who tricked these people -RRB- was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There they would be tortured day and night forever and ever .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I saw a large white throne .|||O O O O O O O O
I saw the one who was sitting on the throne .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared .|||O O O O O O O O O O
And I saw those who had died , great and small , standing before the throne .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some books were opened .|||O O O O O
And another book was opened -- the book of life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The people were judged by what they had done , which is written in the books .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sea gave up the dead who were in it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
All these people were judged by what they had done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This lake of fire is the second death .|||O O O O O O O O O
And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Theoretically I 'll be here .|||O O O O O O
theoretically ?|||O O
yeah .|||O O
You mean , do n't you well , you carry multiple calendars , so you never know ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I do have two .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O
One in the office and one at home .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O

But , %um yeah ,|||O O O O O
as I say , theoretically I 'm here .|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I have n't decided whether I 'm doing this yet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is a bit silly , you know ?|||O O O O O O O O O
I was just there .|||O O O O O
But I 've been , %um ,|||O O O O O O O
the next weekend again I 'm invited for the|||O O O O O O O O O

the child of my favorite cousin is being baptized ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
and they want me to be the godmother|||O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
English .|||B-LANGUAGE O
Patentante , ja .|||O O O O
Yes ,|||O O
And , so , since I did n't go to their wedding , I -- feeling this big pressure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I should have just gone to the wedding last year .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
It was , like oh yeah . in|||O O O O O O O O
They started asking me when I was on vacation already .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And so I 'm sort of|||O O O O O O
it 's easier to think about doing it when you 're on vacation yeah . than if you get this idea %eh when you 're at work and say , oh I ca n't go in four weeks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
How could I possibly just do that ?|||O O O O O O O O
yeah I know the feeling .|||O O O O O O
I m-|||O O
But once you 're in vacation mode , it 's sort of like well why should n't I ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have the vacation ,|||O O O O O
it 's just you know , the time , and the money ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and what is money for|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Right .|||O O
So I have to make up|||O O O O O O
It 's a debate .|||O O O O O
You sound like you 're the bank .|||O O O O O O O O
No .|||O O
But I have to make up my mind here by Friday because that 's when I can hold my ticket too .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
So I thought I could get a ticket .|||O O O O O O O O O
I just have to have a discussion with my boss .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So you have to let me know what this entails as consequences for me ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh for ,|||O O O

oh there are good consequences , if you 're willing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean , aside from|||O O O O O
so I have to be there on the twentieth in Berlin ,|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-GPE O

uh-huh .|||O O
And I could n't go for you know , just , For the day . you know three days .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
So I had to go at least a week .|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
yeah .|||O O
And there was an advantage .|||O O O O O O
It 's because ,|||O O O O
and if you 'd like to join me I 'd love it ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was also invited to a wedding on the twelfth somewhere near Duesseldorf .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-GPE O
Between Duesseldorf and Essen .|||O B-GPE O B-GPE O
Well that can only be Rathingen or|||O O O O O B-GPE O
No it 's north of Rathingen ,|||O O O O O B-GPE O

It 's a fancy wedding too .|||O O O O O O O
Does that mean I have to get|||O O O O O O O
Do I have to wear a tie ?|||O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Sure .|||O O
y-|||O
%um|||O
could be it 's actually|||O O O O O
I ca n't believe this .|||O O O O O O
This is a German friend that I|||O O O B-NORP O O O
he worked here at NASA for like two years and was in mhm our German conversation club .|||O O O O B-ORG O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O O O
yeah .|||O O
And he 's marrying a German woman .|||O O O O O B-NORP O O
I mean he just went back a little while ago because his|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
No he 's an American ,|||O O O O B-NORP O
but he 's marrying a German woman .|||O O O O O B-NORP O O
oh , he 's a German .|||O O O O O B-NORP O
He 's German too .|||O O B-NORP O O
yeah .|||O O
They 're both German .|||O O O B-NORP O
So this is a real mhm . German wedding .|||O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
But|||O
And so he was saying we should come from our|||O O O O O O O O O O
and one other person from our group is going because we would|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
he had n't gotten around to planning his vacation .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So he 's going to be there .|||O O O O O O O O
So I thought well that 's on the twelfth , and the other thing is on the twentieth , you know .|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O
Why not ?|||O O O
And then in between I 'm going to go down and 586.14_588.20_A: see my relatives in Bonn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
oh well the twentieth i- ,|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
I mean that could be a pro- , e-|||O O O O O O O O O
Well no not the twentieth .|||O O O O B-DATE O
The twentieth is my baptism .|||B-DATE I-DATE O O O O
%ah so .|||O O O
The wedding is the twelfth .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
The wedding is the twelfth ?|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
But it 's like a real thing .|||O O O O O O O O
There 's like a wedding at eleven , and a lunch at Schloss Ketwig or something at lunchtime .|||O O O O O O B-TIME O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O B-TIME O
And then at seven o'clock there is , let 's see , %uh dinner dance . mit Abendgarderobe .|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh God . nay|||O O O O
But I thought you playing piano you must have that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Abendgarderobe .|||O O
Does n't that mean like really fancy clothes ?|||O O O O O O O O O
%uh , well .|||O O O O
Ja , ja .|||O O O O
Ball dresses and , you know , tuxedos and things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah , I know .|||O O O O O
I could n't believe it|||O O O O O
because I met ,|||O O O O
when I was there on the other trip , I had n't read the invitation before .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did n't think I was going .|||O O O O O O O O
And so I had met , %uh , his name is Heiko , for one day in Hamburg .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-GPE O
We met .|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
So he mentioned that he was looking for his tuxedo .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And I said you 're going to get married in a tuxedo ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said no , no , no .|||O O O O O O O O
That evening .|||O O O
I 've never heard of such a thing .|||O O O O O O O O O
Quite a wedding .|||O O O O
But so if you want to bow out .|||O O O O O O O O O
Pardon ?|||O O
I said if you really do n't like those things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Well .|||O O
But you know . It 's great meals .|||O O O O O O O O O
Really .|||O O
Free food .|||O O O
Aside from , we can talk ,|||O O O O O O O
and they should be nice people .|||O O O O O O O
It 'll be|||O O O
and then I 'll know one more person there .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
How old are they ?|||O O O O O
oh .|||O O
A little bit younger than us .|||O O O O O O O
oh , he 's probably|||O O O O O
good question .|||O O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
Maybe he 's thirty - two ?|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
That 's okay .|||O O O O
As long as they 're not twenty - one .|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
oh no , no , no , no .|||O O O O O O O O O
No %uh , spring chicken|||O O O O O
This is Herr Doktor Heiko Hecht and Jessika whatever her name is .|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O
ooh .|||O O
They actually met in the United States . At I think the University &of Virginia , where he got his doctorate ?|||O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O
Or , maybe it 's not Virginia ,|||O O O O O O B-GPE O
but it 's somewhere over there .|||O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
Something I do n't know .|||O O O O O O
mhm %hm .|||O O O
yeah ,|||O O
so , you know , they 're not really young .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So I s- ,|||O O O O
their friends I presume are in the same age .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I think there 'll be a lot of family friends .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I have a f-|||O O O O
okay .|||O O
yeah ,|||O O
I 'm sure .|||O O O O
weddings are always family .|||O O O O O
and the way he was talking , it sounds like his wife 's family is well - to - do or something .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so|||O
yeah|||O
well if it , ye-|||O O O O O
Interesting people .|||O O O
If they 're having a wedding with Abendgarderobe then it 's going to be pretty|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's what I thought .|||O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
That 's what I thought .|||O O O O O O
Up upscale .|||O O O
And that .|||O O O
So think about it .|||O O O O O
yeah . I 'll let you think about that ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
and you can write me a note or give me a call .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because I know some people really hate weddings .|||O O O O O O O O O
But you 're afraid to say no ,|||O O O O O O O O
or you have to think about it .|||O O O O O O O O
But it 's the twelfth .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
And otherwise , what I 'd like to try to do is stay with you the twelfth and thirteenth . Because it 's weekend .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-DATE O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
Like we could see each other .|||O O O O O O O
And then I 'll go Monday -- down to Bonn , or wherever those relatives are because I have n't seen my uncle in like three or four years , and he 's just turning eighty and I like them a lot|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
In Bad Muenstereifel ?|||O B-GPE I-GPE O
yeah ,|||O O
I 'll|||O O
guess it 'll be summer|||O O O O B-DATE
so he 'll be in Bad Munstereifel .|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
mhm|||O
They 've actually moved .|||O O O O O
They do n't live in Bonn now .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O
They live in -- %um , Bad Neuena . Which is I guess|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O
Bad Neuena ja .|||B-GPE I-GPE O O
yeah ,|||O O
just a little bit down .|||O O O O O O
But I think they 'll be in Munstereifel .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O
And then my cousin , she still does live in Bonn|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE
so I 'll get to see her .|||O O O O O O O O
And then I 'll zip off to Berlin Right . mhm mhm go to this wedding and see my favorite cousin .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't tell the other cousins .|||O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
Because you see , when I was there before I could n't visit you because I did n't want to spend time visiting these other relatives in Bonn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
you 're so diplomatic about all of that , you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I mean if I was visiting you , it would be very hard not to visit them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but n-|||O O
But the year before I .|||O O O O O O
I would n't , %uh , tell on you , you know .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know you would n't tell .|||O O O O O O O
But the year before I did it .|||O O O O O O O O
But that 's because of we just stopped on the train and I had , you know , two hours .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
And we had our wild lunch .|||O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
And on again .|||O O O O
yeah .|||O O
That 's|||O O
We , %uh , commiserated .|||O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
That sounds like you have you know its positive end result , which is good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
I mean , it 's a change ,|||O O O O O O O O
that 's for sure .|||O O O O O
It 's a change .|||O O O O O
And it is a lot of work , obviously .|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
I ,|||O O
%eh but you know I really do n't know if it 's a lot of work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I always have this feeling I 'm just so terribly slow .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have this feeling I should always be doing these things much faster than I get them done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , so what if you 're slow ?|||O O O O O O O O O
You know , look at it the other way .|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
but I always keep %eh that I 'm spending too much time , that I should be doing other things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I just had this talk about somebody who was you know , confirming , you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I know I 'm too self critical .|||O O O O O O O O O
So . It 's not a good idea .|||O O O O O O O O O
Because I was complaining to them about my mother|||O O O O O O O O O
and they are this theory that , you know , what people do is a reflection of you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%huh .|||O O
Because this woman had such a that people react to you as a reflection of you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And what I had mentioned about my mother bugging me was the fact that every time I see her or we even talk , she has to comment about my clothes , or what I 'm wearing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I was talking to this woman because she seemed to have such a good relationship with her mother .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm yeah|||O O
and so she said you know and she 's just a reflection .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know your mother 's being critical you know .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Be you see that because you 're critical to yourself too much|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Or you 're filtering the information you get from your mother|||O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
but this is ridiculous .|||O O O O O
I mean %uh she 's never let up on that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean it 's crazy . You know .|||O O O O O O O O O
I do n't I mean|||O O O O O
and I think no not the last time the last time on the phone I bugged her about something else that I been trying to not take anymore|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but then she cries|||O O O O
but that does n't work with me .|||O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
That 's good .|||O O O O
Then she says I 'm being mean .|||O O O O O O O O
and I ignore the fact that she 's crying .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm pretty tough .|||O O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
speaking of crying , I have a colleague . An American girl , a dancer . mhm at a school in Cologne mhm Who somehow or other has fallen in love with me .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm|||O
and now that I 'm , going back to Duesseldorf she 's all going crazy . %um and thinks %eh|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
she 's %eh concluded that I 'm abandoning her .|||O O O O O O O O O O
oho|||O
But it is|||O O O
Being stalked here ?|||O O O O
Pardon ?|||O O
In America , we would say are you being stalked ?|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
so he said to let your wife do it you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O
%uh right|||O O
he says %uh you know no I 'm going to|||O O O O O O O O O O
%eh so now I 'm at a point that it 's very strange|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like I wo n't complain about anything|||O O O O O O O
or I ca n't complain about anything|||O O O O O O O
and I ca n't ask him to come help me in the middle of the night when I forgot to take out something they put in the freezer|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So we 'll see how it goes|||O O O O O O O
hopefully|||O
I mean they promise me you know everybody that they 're going to help me and that whatever I say|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you know everybody gives you %uh these %uh pro-|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
so you 've already started|||O O O O O
Well I 've started working with Du|||O O O O O O O
like I do n't cook anymore|||O O O O O O
I have n't worked in the kitchen for a week already|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've been just doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the %um sales people|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and %um I 've learned how to work the computer which is the bigges-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I said I do n't know how to turn it on even|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
really|||O
So I 'm not|||O O O O
I do n't know if I could do it yet by myself|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
but he 's showing me teaching me|||O O O O O O O
and I think like the middle of this week he 'll be there a few days with me|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O
and then anoth-|||O O O
he %um|||O O
Maybe here and there|||O O O O
but he 's really basically|||O O O O O
What is he going to do|||O O O O O O
He 's going to be a teacher for %um High school computers|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh okay|||O O
yeah|||O
so he 's only teaching three days a week|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
so he always says that on the other days if I need him he 'll come in|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the truth is he 's been teaching and very patient and very good|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and he also is great that he has written down everything|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm sure he 's thrilled to get out of there|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I 'll tell you the truth %uh|||O O O O O O O O
I mean now that I worked with him one to one He does do everything with his heart|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean he has a different head than everybody else|||O O O O O O O O O O
like I know that he wants everything to be nice and to be good and|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but he 's very separate|||O O O O O
and he does n't like to listen to other people 's %um ideas|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but %um I 'm sure financially he was probably great for the kibbutz because he was cheap|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
because he 's also|||O O O O
I 'll tell you|||O O O O
I worked with him this whole week|||O O O O O O O
he does n't eat a thing ever|||O O O O O O O
like all morning long|||O O O O
so he does n't eat|||O O O O O
he does n't drink coffee|||O O O O O
I did n't see him drink anything water or anything else|||O O O O O O O O O O O
one day he said I better drink something I have a headache because it was really hot|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I mean you know he does n't eat anything|||O O O O O O O O O O
and then for lunch when we finally went to go get something to eat Also he eats like a little What we would eat maybe half for a meal|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's it|||O O O O
so I can understand now why he thinks that because he does n't have big eyes you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
right|||O
that 's so funny|||O O O O
but anyway|||O O
no|||O
so he had agreed to do it for a year|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE
and his year is over|||O O O O O
I|||O
are you excited at all about it|||O O O O O O O
or|||O
well I 'll tell you the truth|||O O O O O O O
until I made the decision I was scared and also utz|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I miss the cooking part|||O O O O O
You miss it|||O O O
that 's funny|||O O O
I|||O
yeah|||O

like this week even when they made the %um coleslaw you know & kept calling me to taste it and make sure that it was the way that I do it|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and so Matty said to me Ellen you did n't make the coleslaw|||O O B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
I said it 's over you know|||O O O O O O O
I ca n't do everything|||O O O O O
tha-|||O
and they 're going to notice that the cooking is different|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Well that 's what even **ruthie** says you know|||O O O O O O O O O
everyone thinks that the economie is so important|||O O O O O O O O
but there 's a lot of things that are very important of running the kitchen|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we 'll see|||O O O O
%uh right now Ramon %uh|||O O O B-PERSON O
you know Cocoa she got married|||O O B-PERSON O O O
She married that guy|||O O O O
not the Israeli guy not the Sephardic guy but No you 're kidding that little feminine kind of guy|||O O B-NORP O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O
No|||O
but reme-|||O O
when I was there in October she had that guy from Yerushalaim that guy|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-GPE O O

and this guy was a here or something drawer|||O O O O O O O O O
I think his family is Romanian or something|||O O O O O B-NORP O O
anyway|||O
yeah|||O
it was very fast|||O O O O
and they got married|||O O O O
How old is she ?|||O O O O O
She 's eighteen and a half|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
she 'll be nineteen in December|||O O O B-DATE O B-DATE
oh my god|||O O O
why did they allow that|||O O O O O
Well I guess they did n't have a choice|||O O O O O O O O O
but the worst thing was originally when she came to her parents and she was going to get married she was going to get married in October|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE
but she got engaged like before Pesach|||O O O O O O B-EVENT
so going to get married in October|||O O O O O O B-DATE
so they were n't so thrilled|||O O O O O O
but at least okay it 's %uh|||O O O O O O O
and then all of a sudden they came back and said no we want to get married|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they got married the I think oh my g- second week in June|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
on kibbutz|||O O
yeah|||O
it was beautiful|||O O O
we do weddings %eh so much nicer than in the old days|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
first of all we rent tables and chairs|||O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
so it 's like|||O O O O
and we did it on the grass outside the|||O O O O O O O O O
and it was beautiful|||O O O O
we read|||O O
that|||O
so she 's like the first child who got married|||O O O O O O O O O O
right|||O
and we rented beautiful china and silverware and glasses|||O O O O O O O O O
wow|||O
beautiful|||O
I must admit it was really really beautiful|||O O O O O O O O
and then serving everything we use like %um all different kinds of bought kind of %um paper plates that|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
probably like the hard plastic|||O O O O O
and it was amazing because they even had like a bar set up|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and they had oh my go- fruit|||O O O O O O O
they had hay|||O O O
and then they had fruit|||O O O O O
it was gorgeous|||O O O
it was absolutely gorgeous|||O O O O
Does she now have to do tzavah or no|||O O O O O O O O O
no no|||O O
but %ah marriage is|||O O O O
you do n't have to do the tzavah|||O O O O O O O O
oh my go-|||O O O
So she 's working now in the vegetarian kitchen and the a little bit|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but she 's going to study in September|||O O O O O O O B-DATE
so that 's not so long|||O O O O O O
Does she cover her hair|||O O O O O
No|||O
oh I keep|||O O O
that other guy was real|||O O O O O
this one is|||O O O
I can not bel-|||O O O O
oh this other one 's like from a family that 's not at all|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but he|||O O
yeah|||O
they went to America for a month after the wedding|||O O O B-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE O O O
her grandparents sent them %uh oh my Even though they were mad|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
you know the typical Ariella story|||O O O O B-PERSON O
they came for Pesach|||O O O B-EVENT
and then they told them|||O O O O O
they waited to tell them that they got engaged|||O O O O O O O O O
and the wedding is in June|||O O O O O B-DATE
and they were so angry because how the hell could they come back after years|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's true|||O O O
No|||O
so on one hand I understand them|||O O O O O O O
it 's not fair|||O O O O
No of course not|||O O O O
965.04_967.89_B: even they could have called them before Pesach|||O O O O O O O O B-EVENT
maybe they would 've changed their minds|||O O O O O O O
but|||O
wait|||O
yeah|||O
Natan 's sister was here also|||B-PERSON O O O O O
So they were all upset that the grandparents did n't come back for the wedding|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I do n't know|||O O O O O
you have to look at you know both|||O O O O O O O O
oh my|||O O
I ca n't believe she got married|||O O O O O O O
I|||O
she got married|||O O O
and then the week after Ta'al Paer got married|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
you know Ta'al is the oldest %uh girl on the|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
I|||O
yeah|||O
where is she living|||O O O O
Well her husband he looks like Mickey our Mickey yeah when Mickey was really young|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O
so he looks really young|||O O O O O
%uh she just finished now the army|||O O O O O O O
and she met him during the army|||O O O O O O O
he 's from a nonreligious kibbutz|||O O O O O O
oh my gosh|||O O O
yeah|||O
So now they 're living on his kibbutz %um because they allow like B'nai to live there|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O
but I do n't know they can work outside yeah do whatever they want until they decide what they want or do what they want|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do whatever they want|||O O O O
study|||O
I do n't know what they 're doing|||O O O O O O O O
his parents are n't even living on the kibbutz anymore because he 's a professor of something or other in I do n't know China or somewhere|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O
Singapore|||B-GPE
I do n't know where|||O O O O O
anyway so that was really weird|||O O O O O O
like when she got engaged it was a little hard for Rachel because he 's not religious and everyone was really upset|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
gosh you would think at least in Israel you would get what you want|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
No|||O
but not only that|||O O O O
what|||O
this kid just left the kibbutz at eighteen|||O O O O O O O B-DATE
and now at nineteen he 's coming back with &uh you know like|||O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O
He also had a lot of different boyfriends during her lifetime|||O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway to make a long story short she had her wedding also|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
but hers we did like %um a buffet|||O O O O O O O O
so I was really nervous about that because when did we ever do a buffet|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so we rented the tables and chairs again|||O O O O O O O O
and we rented all the beautiful dishes|||O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
But we set up the buffet|||O O O O O O
we bought like these really neat|||O O O O O O
you know like they 're|||O O O O O
Well we saved them because you can wash them|||O O O O O O O O O
they 're made out of plastic|||O O O O O O
but they look like silver trays|||O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
yeah|||O
So we bought all different shapes and sizes|||O O O O O O O O
and we put out the salads and the meats and all different kinds that|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we had %um little cocktail hot dogs|||O O O O O O O
and we had chicken legs|||O O O O O
and we had schnitzels|||O O O O
oh and they made a beautiful basket with breads you know everything falling out on the table|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you know those kind of things|||O O O O O O
no|||O
wow|||O
No|||O
it was beautiful|||O O O
it also came out really nice|||O O O O O O
the only thing|||O O O
you guys must feel so old that you have married children already|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
we do feel old|||O O O O
and it was beautiful|||O O O O
Ramona 's was nicer because they had a great band and everybody was that|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you know like usually in a wedding there 's no room to dance|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the whole parking lot was for dancing|||O O O O O O O O
and on the grass was where we sat|||O O O O O O O O
wow|||O
uh-huh|||O
so it was like as if you would 've seen you know dance festival because there was like a circle of men a circle of girls a circle of her friends a circle of his friends because there was enough room the kids had a circle that you could have like five six different circles all over the place|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh my gosh|||O O O
it was beautiful|||O O O
and Ta'al 's|||O O O
what happened|||O O
you know that Rachel was really worried that people wo n't dance for her be happy for her|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know why|||O O O O O
that was ridiculous because everyone was just as happy|||O O O O O O O O O
but her band they got stuck somewhere|||O O O O O O O
and their %um|||O O O
something with the electric equipment|||O O O O O
it did n't come|||O O O O
so we had to get from us the amplifiers|||O O O O O O O O O
and ours are terrible|||O O O O
%mm oy|||O O
they could n't hear anything|||O O O O O
so So some people got really you know|||O O O O O O O O
just they did n't dance|||O O O O O
and she was really upset|||O O O O O
I said Rachel why did you even bother paying them|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Well that 's true|||O O O O
getting this really great group|||O O O O O
and even if we would 've known they were stuck so call the kibbutz|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we would 've sent the car to go get it|||O O O O O O O O O O
right|||O
oh gosh|||O O
so that was bad news|||O O O O O
but other than that|||O O O O
so anybody else engaged|||O O O O
not yet|||O O
the rest are young|||O O O O
well that whole class that whole first|||O O O O O O O
no|||O
but there was only those two girls Ta'al from the first class|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-PERSON O O B-ORDINAL O
Ramona from the second|||B-PERSON O O B-ORDINAL
now these other kids just finished high school|||O O O O O O O O
like & 's oldest daughter is going to the army next week or two weeks|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE
wow|||O
but does n't she have a son who 's older|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
her son is still in the army|||O O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
no|||O
but he 's not engaged yet|||O O O O O O
I think boys wait a little longer|||O O O O O O O
mhm|||O
yeah maybe|||O O
Is Liat still going with that guy ?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O
Unbelievable .|||O O
yeah|||O
things are g-|||O O O
%eh %eh thank God|||O O O O
really very very happy .|||O O O O O
Very nice .|||O O O
great|||O
what 's with you ?|||O O O O O
%uh , let 's see ,|||O O O O O O
well I 'm still hanging out at Westinghouse .|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O
yeah .|||O O
I have your hat .|||O O O O O
I wear your hat all the time .|||O O O O O O O O
oh goo-|||O O
I thought you know it 's a good hat man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I sent that to you with all %uh good intents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I hope you appreciate it .|||O O O O O O
I do .|||O O O
I wear it all the time .|||O O O O O O O
okay .|||O O
%uh %uh I hope I have %um a picture of myself when I %uh had reserves . you know the other month .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
I took a picture %uh with me|||O O O O O O O
and I hope it comes out .|||O O O O O O O
I 'll send it to you .|||O O O O O O O
Thank you very much .|||O O O O O
%um|||O
If it does n't I 'll take another picture .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's see %uh|||O O O O
Go ahead .|||O O O
Well I 'm still working there you know|||O O O O O O O O
and %uh I 'm on a pretty good project .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
a long term %uh next generation %uh fighter plane .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Really ?|||O O
So that 's %uh kind of good experience I guess .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
And %uh Westinghouse supposedly is making a bid to buy the %uh C B S broadcasting network .|||O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought they bought them already .|||O O O O O O O
Well , you know , it takes months to close a deal|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
so there 's -- %ah . -- lots of speculation -- Right . -- that they 'll have to sell the %uh electronics division in order to do that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and what would happen with you ?|||O O O O O O O
I guess we 'd be sold to another company and see what happens .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
I 'm not too concerned about it though|||O O O O O O O O
but it 's a possibility .|||O O O O O O
But you have a senior position there .|||O O O O O O O O
Well , I suppose so .|||O O O O O O
But , you know . They do n't really think of it that way|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they just look at the numbers how many people they want and how many people they have .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's just a business .|||O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
they just get rid of what they do n't want .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
But %uh that 's still going pretty well .|||O O O O O O O O O
%huh|||O
nothing really new with the house or anything|||O O O O O O O O
We 've had some interesting incidents with wasps that have %uh been invading the neighborhood .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they built a nest in my rafters of my house and busted through .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I told you about that , I think .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I got a in the mail .|||O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
So that|||O O
Well I wanted to ask you what 's with the school ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The schools are extremely expensive .|||O O O O O O
I 'm going broke basically doing that .|||O O O O O O O O
And I do n't know how to %uh handle that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But how come they do n't help you ?|||O O O O O O O O O
It does n't make a difference .|||O O O O O O O
you 're still going to go broke whether they help you or not .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're not going to let you run a profit when you 're on scholarship .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have two thousand dollars at the end of the year they 're not going to say oh well %uh I guess you can have that .|||O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're going to make you pay everything .|||O O O O O O O O O
Wait a minute|||O O O
I 'm talking about|||O O O O
wait|||O
wait fir-|||O O
I 'm talking about your schooling .|||O O O O O O O
My schooling ?|||O O O
I thought you meant the kids ' school .|||O O O O O O O O O
My schooling ?|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
I put it on hold all the time .|||O O O O O O O O O
took a course last semester|||O O O O O
I have n't signed up yet for the fall|||O O O O O O O O O
It 's a lot of stress .|||O O O O O O O
It 's a lot of stress .|||O O O O O O O
trying to|||O O
you know you put out a lot of money|||O O O O O O O O O
and you have to work really hard to get it back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
there 's not necessarily any benefit to it either .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So|||O
%hm .|||O O
sorry I was talking about the kids ' school .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Right|||O
the kids . yeah|||O O O O
R J told me how much -- yeah . -- it costs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But meanwhile -- It 's a lot of money . -- she does n't know how much you pay .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know why that is .|||O O O O O O O O
I think what we pay|||O O O O O
%um %mm we have to %uh|||O O O O O O
%uh for two kids it cost about two hundred dollars apiece .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh ?|||O O
And then for %um the taxes and everything else maybe if it costs %uh a year %um maybe %uh seven hundred dollars a kid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O
okay .|||O O
That 's total everything .|||O O O O O
Pretty much .|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
Pretty much .|||O O O
So we 're paying about eight times that .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
No about five times that .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O
yeah|||O
five times that|||B-CARDINAL O O
No , actually , %ah we 're paying six times that .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
I 'm paying four thousand two hundred dollars a kid . %uh Or more .|||O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Right .|||O O
But then you could also look into the other part . the tax bracket|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
here f- %uh|||O O O
yeah|||O
forty - five|||O O O
forty - five , actually with all the other taxes that are going on here|||B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
the first job %uh I pay forty - five percent -- mhm . -- my salary .|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O
It goes to taxes .|||O O O O O
And then with all of my second job , it already comes out to fifty - five percent of that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O
%mm %mm %mm .|||O O O O
Plus the taxes .|||O O O O
Unbelievable .|||O O
That 's incredible .|||O O O O
I remember I got the first paycheck|||O O O O O B-ORDINAL O
yeah|||O
I pretty much knew that 's what the statistics were .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
As soon as you get the paycheck and you see the before tax income and you say wow finally you 're able to get up to a decent number and then you look at the bottom|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and you say what is this .|||O O O O O O O
You put it into your little pocket calculator --|||O O O O O O O O O
-- you say they 're taking fifty - five percent|||O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT
says fifty - five percent .|||O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O
I say what country -- -- in their right mind takes fif-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
what about %eh trying to encourage the populace to go to work and to save more , to earn more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%uh they do n't care .|||O O O O O O
But you still like it there ?|||O O O O O O O
Fifty - five|||B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL
But yo-|||O O
yeah ,|||O O
because you 're able|||O O O O
You 're still|||O O O
%hm ?|||O O
It 's great .|||O O O O
It 's great .|||O O O O
We enjoy it .|||O O O O
The kids are happy .|||O O O O O
Having a wonderful time .|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
And %um even with all the political nonsense that goes on here you still feel that we 're %uh %uh building the place in a very small way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And also the community .|||O O O O O
we love it here .|||O O O O O
Well I 'm sure you do .|||O O O O O O O
It 's a great community .|||O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
It 's a nice place .|||O O O O O O
It 's a very nice place .|||O O O O O O O

What are they all liars ?|||O O O O O O
I mean , what 's the story here ?|||O O O O O O O O O
You 're i-|||O O O
Yes .|||O O
First of all , Israeli who is living in America -- yeah . -- has to justify himself .|||B-ORDINAL O O O B-NORP O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
So that 's what he 's going to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I suppose so|||O O O
because man he 's just like one thing after the next .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
you 're into software , right ?|||O O O O O O O

For %uh a %uh nice apartment you can|||O O O O O O O O
house like my size is|||O O O O O
the house I have -- mhm . -- would go for about five hundred dollars %uh five fifty a month .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O
Wow that 's great .|||O O O O O
Right .|||O O
So you can work down to a small apartment yeah %um which wo- %um probably go for about %uh three %uh hundred and fifty dollars .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O
and where are most of these jobs located ?|||O O O O O O O O O
%uh|||O
Some of these Hertzolia|||O O O B-GPE
Hertzolia|||B-GPE
yeah .|||O O
That 's not so bad .|||O O O O O O
Right|||O
Tel Aviv Hertzolia|||B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE
Even now they opened up a lot of new roads now they were building since you were here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
But %ah they were building while you were here .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
%um and you can also|||O O O O O
Audrey said she got to Tel Aviv the other day in like forty - five minutes|||B-PERSON O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME
Wow . With the traffic and everything ?|||O O O O O O O O
with yeah the traffic|||O O O O
there was no traffic until she got right there to %uh yeah Tel Aviv|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE
%mm %mm %mm|||O O O
So yeah|||O O
it 's a|||O O O
But you 're talking about jobs in good places , good solid companies developing companies who %um|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the thing just for the fun of it then %uh|||O O O O O O O O O O
You know how I feel that|||O O O O O O
yeah|||O
little Liz has her own reasons for you know being in America .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
You should feel comfortable staying there ,|||O O O O O O O
just for the fun %uh %ah send me %uh %ah a resume|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay . I 'll do that .|||O O O O O O O
And I 'll just pass it on just to get an idea of how much you may be able to make .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That sounds okay|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
I think that 's a excellent idea .|||O O O O O O O O
%um , I know your wife does n't believe me|||O O O O O O O O O O
but %uh we think about you guys like continuously .|||O O O O O O O O O O
and it really %uh makes my heart ache .|||O O O O O O O O O
But %uh|||O O
yeah|||O
until like you find something that is n't stressful and not boring .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
that 's the main two combinations right ?|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
yeah .|||O O
Not stressful and not boring|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Well it 's like I have no problems with secretarial work|||O O O O O O O O O O O
okay that 's what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough secretary you know %eh %mm . you do n't get bored because you are always doing something different|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know two if's there|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
mhm .|||O O
but you get no respect|||O O O O O
I mean oh you 're a secretary|||O O O O O O O
and the pay is pretty crummy|||O O O O O O
well it 's pretty much the same as what I 'm getting you know %um depending upon where you work and all|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you know it 's like that 's no answer either|||O O O O O O O O O O O
so I 've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully employed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But anyway ,|||O O O
and you can think about that pregnancy thing|||O O O O O O O O
oh yeah|||O O
that pregnancy thing|||O O O
yeah|||O
that|||O
do the|||O O
Maybe there 's your hormones calling .|||O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
well no|||O O
the funny thing is it 's like ten years ago I would 've said oh yeah that was what I really wanted to be doing is having a baby you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but like at this point in time it 's kind of like we 're going to do it because if we do n't do it %uh %eh you know in the next year or two we 'd regret it you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
we figure it 's something we 'd want to do|||O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not like we 're doing it because we have to do it or there 's peer pressure|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or well a %mm little peer pressure|||O O O O O O O
oh no no no|||O O O O
I know exactly where you 're at because I think about that too|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I got about like six or seven years|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE
I figure my body is a very slow %um yeah **maturer**|||O O O O O O O O O O O
you know what I mean|||O O O O O
like I did n't get my period until I was sixteen|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE
I mean I look like about %uh %uh at least five or six years younger than I actually am|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
-- and I 'm just starting to get my period actually now -- yeah yeah as an adult .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I kind of figure well I 'm probably good until at least some time in the early forties|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
and I could probably go a little longer than that|||O O O O O O O O O O
I know there 's a risk and all that bullshit|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
but %um yeah I think about that too because it 's like I mean I kind of like the way things are going in the total lack of responsibility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know|||O O
well I mean that 's the thing|||O O O O O O O
kids are cute and all that|||O O O O O O
and we %mm slept until noon|||O O O O O B-TIME
we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get out of bed played with the cats fell back to sleep|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay I mean we 're talking total slackers|||O O O O O O O O
%mm|||O
and I thought gee you know if we had a kid we could n't do this you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and|||O
%mm|||O
No|||O
you got to be focused on that|||O O O O O O O
and I mean there 's a lots of other things that|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean as far as like living situation I was feeling kind of settled you know like -- Right . I 'm not going to be like traipsing around|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe -- yeah . -- ten years alright|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
even if I could project that far which I really ca n't|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
but I mean you got a kid you ca n't do fucking ten years w- --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
I know .|||O O O
-- it 's like cool I think I 'll go off to the Orient and start like bouncing from country country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O
I know|||O O
well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
so we 'll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the program which hopefully -- %mm . -- you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then there 's four or five years doing the damn work|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O
and %mm . He 's crazy|||O O O O O O
he wants it|||O O O
that 's fine|||O O O
he can do it|||O O O O
no problem|||O O
but %um that sort of ties us up here although we like the place|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 're in no hurry to leave it|||O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
and that would be good|||O O O O O
But then you know what if he could get a position overseas again which is something both of us have said would be pretty darn good because -- %mm . -- %um you know after coming back from Spain from those two and half years it was n't so much an adjustment to the way things were|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's just asking the question gee do we really like %um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O
I mean I 'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
you know he should be there by oh oh well let 's say eight thirty to nine|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O B-TIME
but yeah|||O O
he does n't care when|||O O O O O
well okay|||O O
%um and his professor is obviously %uh %uh a great person to work for|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so I 'm envious|||O O O O
but %um whatever|||O O O
you know I 'm caught up %mm . -- in it|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and I do n't like it you know|||O O O O O O O O
too many days I 'm working and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME
and I 'm thinking %mm . This is crazy you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O
in Spain %uh we had this break|||O B-GPE O O O O O
and you sat|||O O O
you talked to people you know|||O O O O O O
you enjoyed your food|||O O O O
you relaxed -- %mm . -- you know|||O O O O O O O O
and it 's a fairly productive nation right you know|||O O O O O O O O O O
What 's going on here ?|||O O O O O O
yeah|||O
I mean they both have the advantages and disadvantages|||O O O O O O O O O
what you have to do is concentrate on the advantages in what ever place you 're in -- mhm -- and think about the disadvantages of the place that you 're not in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
Otherwise you go nuts right ?|||O O O O O O
That 's true ,|||O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
I know Laura tried to|||O O B-PERSON O O
%uh because we have email and so she sent me a letter back saying you know remember how crowded the transportation is and %uh what else -- %mm . how expensive everything is|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and %uh you know I remember those things of course you know --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And work you know possibilities were a lot more limited|||O O O O O O O O O O
True .|||O O
and the language you know yeah . constantly like kind of|||O O O O O O O O O O O
like I mean those could be considered positive things as well|||O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie- rather than|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm sure|||O O
They just like worrying over them .|||O O O O O O O
Well you know and that 's why it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And that 's how we got to -- %mm . -- Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it turned out that way because -- %mm . -- we had this idea of|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I really feel that that 's important|||O O O O O O O O
and so what I 'm having an idea of now is|||O O O O O O O O O O O
okay you know Emory works on his doctorate|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O
it takes about five or six years|||O O O B-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE
we have the kid probably|||O O O O O
he gets a research position somewhere in France or in Spain %um|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O
and then we move over there|||O O O O O O
and you know I take care of the kid and do some you know little day labor whatever you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll see|||O O O
%mm .|||O O
%um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten years|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE
and then we take it from there .|||O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
because even like you know I mean all that stuff right is all so subject to whatever change in the weather that happens to be right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
oh I know|||O O O
I know|||O O
and it 's like you know what I think because I get the same as you|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like some days it 's just kind of like you know what the hell am I doing not with my life but ge-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I mean just like where do I get the animal just you know to do anything you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I just lay in bed and dream for the whole day easily|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
I know .|||O O O
Well I know|||O O O
I know what you 're saying|||O O O O O O
I feel there 's sort of a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and stressing over it because for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said is this what we really want to be worrying about right now|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and you know I realize no|||O O O O O O
yeah absolutely .|||O O O
and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or I know I have this tendency to do that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And miss the present completely|||O O O O O
I mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan yeah . yeah yeah . you know and each little|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean it 's like as far as I 'm concerned there 's like no pleasure that 's as intense as the one that you are experiencing at that moment you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can think about what something might be like or reminisce about the past|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but like when you 're there in that moment it 's|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean everything else just kind of like|||O O O O O O O O
it 's almost like time does n't exist . yeah . You know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
Well I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two months is|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
okay I get to work a little bit late which is common|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and they do n't really care since I 'm an hourly you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to be within a certain time frame|||O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
and so everyone else is parked .|||O O O O O O O
I 'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and you know I close the door|||O O O O O O O
I just take a deep breath as I go okay another day|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I hear the birds singing --|||O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it sort of cheers me up|||O O O O O O O
you know I realize what a minute okay|||O O O O O O O O
in that nasty sterile office where the windows do n't even open --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%eh %um I will be for the next eight hours or so|||O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O
but out here there still is some life going on|||O O O O O O O O O O
and just sort of cheers me up to know that|||O O O O O O O O O O
okay|||O
I can come back to it you know|||O O O O O O O O
So that 's|||O O O
yeah|||O
in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with that at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There you are you and the birds you know|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
yup|||O
hey we can find good Spanish wine over here speaking of the moment you know|||O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O
oh yeah|||O O
And every once in a while you know I can remember just being back %um with people or eating some place you know in Barcelona|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE
and %uh so it brings me back|||O O O O O O O
but|||O
I still have n't gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house|||O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
%um|||O
I 'm like dying to go there|||O O O O O O O
You mean the one right next to the apartment|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah yeah yeah|||O O O
Well it 's not French|||O O O O B-NORP
it 's just gourmet|||O O O O
it 's gourmet catalon --|||O O O O O
oh it 's not|||O O O O
oh I thought it was Fre-|||O O O O O O
%ah really|||O O
yeah yeah|||O O
Well even better .|||O O O O
save it for a special occasion you know|||O O O O O O O O
and you know you might need a reservation too|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah %um|||O O
yeah|||O
I will|||O O
I should have some visitors|||O O O O O
and my family 's planning on coming this summer|||O O O O O O O O O
so I 'll take them there and this fondue place I wanted to take them to also .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah yeah|||O O
Is the one over in Gracia that|||O O O O O B-GPE O
it 's kind of on a corner I think|||O O O O O O O O O
I think I|||O O O
%uh|||O
no|||O
there 's a couple places in Gracia that I 've been going to|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
But %uh there 's one in the %um Bario Gottigo|||O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC
actually it 's on the other side of Leotana %huh . Like down over by the Bornillo|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
okay .|||O O
And I 've only eaten there once alright|||O O O O O O O O
but I 've been in a million times because every time I pass with somebody I have to show them the place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
Actually you know I know where I 'm going to go|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I have a friend my friend from England|||O O O O O O O B-GPE
I do n't remember if I told you about her|||O O O O O O O O O O
she 's my old %um roommate mhm . From Oviato|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE
and she 's coming|||O O O O
she got a job down here|||O O O O O O
she 's coming on Friday to live|||O O O O B-DATE O O
mhm|||O
And %ah I|||O O O
this is like the perfect|||O O O O O
because when we lived in Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
that would be the perfect place to take her when she gets her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
well I 'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and %uh %um think that you were able to stay|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was a little bit worried at first you know when you got back there because the money would run out probably in April or so|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O
and you know|||O O O
yeah|||O
And I mean I knew I would get a job|||O O O O O O O O O O
and after I just stopped thinking about it I just thought well fuck it|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am going|||O O O
it 's like inevitable|||O O O O
and I want something|||O O O O
I have to get something|||O O O O O
and I will|||O O O
uh-huh|||O
%um %huh|||O O
But I just thought that you know I 'll get a job|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and at this point if I get desperate I 'll just have to take anything|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
And the fact that I like kind of fell into something that 's Fairly sweet|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean %eh in the beginning everything kind of starts out nice|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
but I 'm changing my attitude to the point where I 'm not going to get stressed out about it too much .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm not going to try to change anything|||O O O O O O O O O
Good|||O
I 'm going to go in there|||O O O O O O O
I 'm going to do a nice job|||O O O O O O O O
I 'm going to have a good time uh-huh . you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I 'm not going to|||O O O O O O
I mean it 's not the same|||O O O O O O O
I 'm either|||O O O
like from working with kids|||O O O O O
I mean that was like you know my career for like eight years|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
mhm .|||O O
But this is you know more like|||O O O O O O O
it 's nice|||O O O
it 's really nice|||O O O O
Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know working at least in the States|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you can work in some place in Spain too with l- %ah|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah ,|||O O
I do n't have a big draw for it right now|||O O O O O O O O O O O
if anything like I 've always wanted to have like a bar or a restaurant|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean it takes tons of money|||O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
me too|||O O
well|||O
well|||O
But like I 'd love to|||O O O O O O
That 's why I want to win the lottery first though Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but %um well|||O O O
yeah|||O
well %um good|||O O O
and so you 're probably not going to come back Christmas which is cool|||O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT O O O
Emory was telling me that|||O O O O O
so|||O
yeah|||O
and I probably wo n't|||O O O O O
%eh %eh if there 's anything that you think we should be %um working for let us know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh I do n't know|||O O O O O
I do n't know|||O O O O
it 's too difficult|||O O O O
%uh the thing with the Golan to give it back not to give it back I do n't know|||O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everybody has a different opinion|||O O O O O
we 've got cousins living there|||O O O O O O
beautiful beautiful home|||O O O
and|||O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
I do n't know|||O O O O
one half their mind is thinking should they pack the suitcases|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and the other half is should we add on another room for the new baby you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%eh it 's awful|||O O O O
yeah|||O
it 's a crazy crazy|||O O O O O
it is|||O O

and I knew that underlying it they really believe that because if it 's so wonderful|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
they know everyone dies|||O O O O
but underneath they feel maybe you do n't die until you 're very very old|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The cheers and hails of happiness at a wedding in Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip turned into screams and moans of pain after one of the celebrators lost control of his weapon , from which a number of bullets were released that killed the groom 's brother and hit three other relatives of his , turning the wedding into a funeral in moments .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Gaza Strip residents are suffering from the problem of aggravation from the weapons mess and security chaos resulting from the intense spread of weapons in the hands of security agency individuals and members of factions and families .|||B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a common practice that claimed the lives of about 350 people last year , according to Palestinian human rights sources .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
Mohamed Al Bashiti , 18 -LRB- years old -RRB- , a relative of the victim , mentioned that while the young men were performing dances and popular dabke dances Thursday evening , and while they were in a state of intense rejoicing for the wedding of our relative , Majed Al Bashiti , one of the armed men lost control of his weapon , which he was trying to use to fire to celebrate and greet the groom .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

An elderly man said , " I asked them not to shoot and asked them for God 's sake not to do it , but they persisted in it , until what happened happened .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A number of women suffered cases of fainting and shock after the tragic accident . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A few days ago , another Taiwanese star passed away .|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-NORP O O O O
I had never heard of her .|||O O O O O O O
I hear she was a talented beauty .|||O O O O O O O O
What a great pity !|||O O O O O
The accident was a car crash .|||O O O O O O O
Much of the entertainment news denounced that +her car 's front airbag failed to release , which caused the death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact , the MINI COOPER she was riding in is not what the reports said .|||O O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT O O O O O O O O O O O
It is the car with the highest safety index .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It is sold for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong .|||O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-GPE I-GPE O
Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars .|||B-PRODUCT O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O
It 's just a cute little car , preferred by girls .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But safety is surely not too big of a problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The collision happened on the side and rear .|||O O O O O O O O O
So , the side airbag and air curtain were fully opened .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They opened at the time of first collision with the protective fence .|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
The first collision was with the protective fence only , and the impact on the people was very small .|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , there was the protection of the air curtain .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , there would surely not be a big problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The real fatal collision was the second one from the tailgating truck .|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
At that time , all the airbags were already deflated .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no protective effect .|||O O O O O O
Furthermore , the force of this one was extremely large .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If the car had been stopped at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is common knowledge .|||O O O O O
Then it came down to who had the bad luck of sitting on the side of the car that was angled out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was perfectly correct for the front airbag not to open , because the front of the car was not damaged at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Just imagine , this was a rear collision .|||O O O O O O O O O
The people went backward abruptly .|||O O O O O O
Their bodies could have been supported by the seats , but the impact on their necks and heads was tremendous .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When they went abruptly backward , any additional misfortune of the front airbag opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , the front airbag will not open during a rear collision .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the front airbag opened after being tailgated , that would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So , infants are strictly forbidden from sitting in the front seat .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That was how the whole accident took place .|||O O O O O O O O O
The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn from a single glance at the car wreckage .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The car and the car manufacturer have no fault .|||O O O O O O O O O O
All of the car 's passive safety protections had already fully carried out their functions .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , it is extremely ridiculous and unscientific to blame and suspect the car and the car manufacturer for such an accident .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In particular , speculation about why the front airbags did not open was very amateurish .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only by not opening would it have been correct .|||O O O O O O O O O O
If they had opened , her assistant might still be lying in the hospital .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If an accident occurs on the freeway , please get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many freeway accidents occur simply because people stay inside the car and sort out their thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
About death , I have always believed that they do not leave the world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They only leave the human world .|||O O O O O O O
They are surely sharing the same world with us , with a different manifestation of life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It is in change that we find purpose .|||O O O O O O O O O

I have kept the good habit of having my teeth cleaned ever since I knew it could claim my life if I abruptly go to clean my teeth after years of leaving them uncleaned .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O
After my still upright but " left - tilting " teeth crouched in my mouth safely and soundly for another two years , another revolution erupted half a year after I graduated and found a job .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O
The revolution could be said a rudimentary one , which made me decide eventually to eliminate all the betrayers and heretics in one action !.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The incident was caused by a molar .|||O O O O O O O O
The location of the tooth was just next to the broken wisdom tooth that led to my first visit to an American dentist .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O B-NORP O O
For some unknown reason , when I was eating the other day , the tooth suddenly ached during the meal , and it was very painful .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unexpected I heard a " crack " while I was eating , and part of the tooth fell off !.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could not remember eating anything hard ?!.|||O O O O O O O O
I rushed to the dentist , who said root canal therapy upon seeing it , your dental nerve had come out !.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did not know what root canal meant but thought the name was quite fancy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was after I began to receive it that I found it really painful !.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For example killing the nerves , and dealing with the dental crown ...|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked the dentist then why my tooth broke .|||O O O O O O O O O O
After examining my 25 teeth , the dentist told me seriously that the teeth on the right side were somewhat " cross biting " due to the " parallel shift " of my teeth , such that the upper and lower right teeth were always against each other .|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The wrong position had led to uneven abrasions , resulting in the broken tooth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked what solutions are available ?|||O O O O O O O
The dentist said " correction . "|||O O O O O O O
Thus , three years after I ran away from the " brigand orthodontist , " I stepped into the orthodontist 's office again ...|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Your uncle is just your uncle .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON
This morning I went to the supermarket with Dad , and when it came time to check out I discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
In fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories -LRB- here I 'm being inaccurate ; I hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with IO expertise -RRB- .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co-workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number 200 , and that is already a lot of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
Below I am going to refer to these 200 people collectively as " his uncle . "|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
So whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : My uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and I have it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If Americans had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .|||O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe that they made such a complete mess of the Middle East to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the Middle East , which is a completely different place from the United States .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
On this issue , China does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; China 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever China does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore I believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Suicide murders are not a new invention|||O O O O O O O
but they have been made popular , if I may use this expression , only lately .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even after September 11 , it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon .|||O O B-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O
It is a very potent psychological weapon .|||O O O O O O O O

So what is all the fuss about suicide killings ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
It creates headlines .|||O O O O
It is spectacular .|||O O O O
It is frightening .|||O O O O
It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is always shown on television in great detail .|||O O O O O O O O O O
One such murder , with the help of hysterical media coverage , can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while , as it did in Bali and in Turkey .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O
But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World .|||O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O

Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How about the lines to the check - in counters in a busy travel period ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

and this line will be the target , not to speak of killing the guards themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it is a war !|||O O O O O O
What is behind the suicide murders ?|||O O O O O O O
Money is , money and power and cold - blooded murderous incitement , nothing else .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up .|||O B-NORP O O O O O O O
No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up .|||O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
No relative of anyone influential has done it .|||O O O O O O O O O
Would n't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves , or to talk their sons into doing it , if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are n't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Instead , they send outcast women , naive children , retarded people and young incited hotheads .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They promise them the delights , mostly sexual , of the next world , and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The poorest region in the world , by far , is Africa .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
It never happens there .|||O O O O O
There are numerous desperate people in the world , in different cultures , countries and continents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives , reconnaissance and transportation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was certainly more despair in Saddam 's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer 's Iraq ,|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-GPE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON B-GPE O
and no one exploded himself .|||O O O O O O
A suicide murder is simply a horrible , vicious weapon of cruel , inhuman , cynical , well - funded terrorists , with no regard to human life , including the life of their fellow countrymen , but with very high regard to their own affluent well - being and their hunger for power .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only way to fight this new `` popular '' weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas : the offensive way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Like in the case of organized crime , it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must go after the head of the `` Family '' .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
If part of the public supports it , others tolerate it , many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood , organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The United States understands this now , after September 11 .|||B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT O

Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another , always surrounded by children ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

But it can not be avoided .|||O O O O O O O
Suppose , for the sake of discussion , that someone would openly stay in a well - known address in Teheran , hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it , executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France , killing hundreds of innocent people , accepting responsibility for the crimes , promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same , while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him , invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice - skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister , because such an act is unthinkable , international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals , mosques and ambulances , while being protected by their Government or society .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones , stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country , which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law , and define all those who attack them as `` war criminals , '' with some Western media repeating the allegations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The good news is that all of this is temporary ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O
because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder , not during and not after .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After every world war , the rules of international law have changed , and the same will happen after the present one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But during the twilight zone , a lot of harm can be done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The picture I described here is not pretty .|||O O O O O O O O O
What can we do about it ?|||O O O O O O O
In the short run , only fight and win .|||O O O O O O O O O O
In the long run , only educate the next generation and open it to the world .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The outer circle can not be eliminated by force .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite , more power to women , more education , counter-propaganda , boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media , internet and the international scene .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Above all , we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O

When you have a malignant tumor , you may remove the tumor itself surgically .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body , thereby preventing new `` supplies '' from expanding the tumor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you want to be sure , it is best to do both .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But before you fight and win , by force or otherwise , you have to realize that you are in a war , and this may take Europe a few more years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O

Syria is surrounded by Turkey , Iraq , Jordan and Israel .|||B-GPE O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O
This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-GPE O

In my humble opinion , the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime .|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is ruthless .|||O O O O
It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces , using Iranian Embassies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O

Its so - called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the `` good - cop versus bad - cop '' game .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism ,|||B-GPE O B-NORP O O
it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq ,|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
it is fully funding the Hezbollah and , through it , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad ;|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-NORP B-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG O
it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia|||O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE
and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium , which includes , as minor players , Syria , Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O B-NORP O O B-GPE O
Nevertheless , most European countries still trade with Iran , try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals .|||O O O B-NORP O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah , Sadr and other Iranian - inspired enterprises .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG O O B-NORP O O B-ORG O B-ORG O O B-NORP O O O O
When it serves their business needs , all of them collaborate beautifully .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle , which is the fertile breeding ground of terror .|||O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations , to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety , financial interests or ignorance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Above all , never surrender to terror .|||O O O O O O O O

But it really does not matter .|||O O O O O O O
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O
The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries , including France , who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq .|||O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
In the long run , Spain itself will pay even more .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
Is the solution a democratic Arab world ?|||O O O O O B-NORP O O
If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press , free speech , a functioning judicial system , civil liberties , equality to women , free international travel , exposure to international media and ideas , laws against racial incitement and against defamation , and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals , places of worship and children , then yes , democracy is the solution .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If democracy is just free elections , it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected , the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have seen it already in Algeria and , to a certain extent , in Turkey .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
It will happen again , if the ground is not prepared very carefully .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , a certain transition democracy , as in Jordan , may be a better temporary solution , paving the way for the real thing , perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O B-GPE O

But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war , the more costly and painful the victory will be .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A pattern rarely admitted by the West 's institutional media .|||O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O

For the Chinese Communists killing is also necessary for practical reasons .|||O O B-NORP B-NORP O O O O O O O O
The Communist Party began as a group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power .|||O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Once this precedent was set , there was no going back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Constant terror was needed to intimidate people and force them to accept , out of fear , the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP B-ORG I-ORG O
In a normal society , people show care and love for one another , hold life in awe and veneration and give thanks to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Conversely , the CCP holds that `` The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . ''|||O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to keep alive the `` struggles '' within society , hatred must be generated .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not only does the CCP take lives , it encourages people to kill each other .|||O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O
It strives to desensitize people towards others ' suffering by surrounding them with constant killing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane brutality , and develop the mentality that `` the best you can hope for is to avoid being persecuted . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All these lessons taught by brutal suppression enable the CCP to maintain its rule .|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O
In addition to the destruction of countless lives , the CCP also destroyed the soul of the Chinese people .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-NORP O O
