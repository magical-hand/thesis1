-- basically , it was unanimously agreed upon by the various relevant parties .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To express its determination , the Chinese securities regulatory department compares this stock reform to a die that has been cast .|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It takes time to prove whether the stock reform can really meet expectations , and whether any deviations that arise during the stock reform can be promptly corrected .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Good-bye , dear viewers .|||O O O O O
Hello , dear viewers .|||O O O O O
Welcome to Focus Today .|||O O B-ORG I-ORG O
Today , let 's turn our attention to a road cave - in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday .|||B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
Before dawn on January 3 , a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge , East Third Ring Road , Beijing Municipality , resulting in the road caving in .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans .|||O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O
The traffic administration department carried out traffic supervision near the accident scene .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , how did the emergency response mechanisms activated by governmental departments operate effectively during the holiday ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the holiday , what will be done to handle citizens ' peak commute ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , what measures did relevant departments take to resolve issues such as waste discharge , heating , and communication , in order to ensure that the lives of citizens were not affected ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , we have invited two honorable guests to the studio today to follow this topic with us .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O
One of the two honorable guests in the studio is Professor Zhou Hanhua from the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences .|||B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Hello .|||O O
Next is Yang Yang , a host of Beijing Traffic Radio Station .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Hello .|||O O
Welcome both of you to the studio to participate in our program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , I especially want to know , ha , how the two of you found out the news on the day of the accident ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , , about 11:00 m. yesterday , ah , I happened to find out through an SMS when I was outside .|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
It happened that I was going to have lunch with a friend , um , at noon .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME O
And then , the friend first sent me an SMS , Uh-huh . saying he would come pick me up to go together .|||O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After that , I received an SMS from 1860 .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
Uh-huh , it was through an SMS .|||O O O O O O O O
And you , Yang Yang ?|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
A friend happened to call me .|||O O O O O O O
You were not at work that day ?|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
No .|||O O
The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program .|||O O O O O B-TIME O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh , that means , er , you found out the accident through an information source at the station .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , right , right .|||O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Well , like Professor Zhou , I also received this news , ha , through a mobile phone SMS .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At that time , , it can be said that this SMS was among the many , ha , SMS containing New Year wishes , like Happy New Year , received after the start of the New Year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Ah , actually I felt a lot of warmth when I received that SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although we live in the west instead of the east and it did not affect us much , I think it is very useful , ah , to inform people of this kind of news .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , exceptionally .|||O O O O
Yes , exceptionally .|||O O O O
Well , what in fact was the content of that SMS ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's take a look via this footage , ha .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I remember the SMS was written like this at that time , saying that , ah , there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road , and , well , traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road , Jingguang Bridge , and East Third Ring Road , and requesting cars to make a detour .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O
Some car owners said that it was very good that the SMS was sent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , there was one last sentence in that SMS thanking citizens for their cooperation and support .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , after the SMS was sent , , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality , ah , used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know , all of us are living in Beijing , is this the first time , Professor Zhou ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O B-PERSON O
Yes , in terms of an official notification , this should be the first time one was sent officially through 1860 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Of course , in private life , people have used SMS countless times to spread news .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Other places in the country must have used this too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh , uh-huh .|||O O O O
Must have used this too .|||O O O O O O
Actually , I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed , since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
However , it did not give people such a special feeling as it did this time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Ah , when an SMS is sent to inform citizens of such an incident , can it be considered a work method or expression of government information transparency ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , this is indeed through the very successful response to this emergency , ah , by Beijing Municipality , Uh-huh . an extremely good point that is worth pondering deeply , worthy innovation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
For instance , previously our news announcements were made through some conventional methods , but this time it was made in the form of a mobile phone SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact , this is a method highly emphasized in various countries ' development of e-government .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We usually make it sound like e-government is something unattainable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , when we talked about e-government in the past , it seemed to be only done through the Internet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
It seemed that computers , ah , and the Internet , ah , were an expression of e-government , to let people find out information .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , presently in fact , e-governments in various countries apply this so - called last multiple - exposure method , such as call centers , such as electronic IDs , and such as , these electronic signatures .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These are quite sophisticated forms .|||O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
In particular , more terminals , such as , this cable television , ah , , this digital television , ah , and mobile phone SMS , are applied in e-government .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence , I think this is , a test of e-government because , as I remember , during SARS in 2003 , people at that time criticized e-government during the spread of SARS , ah .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
They said that e-government was very good but was not put into use .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , this time I think that a short SMS like this can fully create interaction between the government and the public through this e-government form .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Yes .|||O O
We drive often in Beijing , ha , Yang Yang .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
If people were not informed of such a traffic accident through SMS on that day and they continued to head there , what do you think would happen if people did not know what was going on and the jam did not clear ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Ah , well , I think it would have been real paralysis .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the most appropriate word to use .|||O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , I think that when SMS was used to announce the news , it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O
Why is that so ?|||O O O O O
This is because , it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage .|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically , in China , ah .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O
So , it can be said that penetration was quite high this time , by using the most familiar method , most used by everyone , as well as the most prompt and most convenient method , for the announcement .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I noticed that many friends , around me received it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It seems that almost everyone received this SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Yes .|||O O
The effect was extremely good , ha .|||O O O O O O O O
So , how exactly did citizens react ?|||O O O O O O O O
Let 's take a look at the reactions of citizens .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
-- an SMS .|||O O O O
I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge .|||O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O
Hey , I say , this is quite good , quite good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Have you received information like this before ?|||O O O O O O O O
No , no .|||O O O O
This was the first time .|||O O O B-ORDINAL O O
The first time ?|||O B-ORDINAL O O
Yes , yes .|||O O O O
Well , what do you think of the speed at which the government responded this time ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Quite fast .|||O O O
Really quite fast , ah .|||O O O O O O
So , I did not drive today .|||O O O O O O B-DATE O
I set out a bit earlier and took the subway here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you think that the response of the government was fast this time ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , the response was quite fast .|||O O O O O O O O
In addition , various media announcements were also quite prompt .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Colleagues and friends also informed one another by phone calls and SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think this plan was quite speedy .|||O O O O O O O O
It seems that through this kind of SMS , citizens responded very well and the effect was excellent , ha .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , apart from the , ah , point on information disclosure brought out by this accident , the fact is that the activation of emergency contingency plans by the , ah , government has also left people with a very deep impression .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's find out the situation at that time through some footage .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , we know that after the road cave - in accident , ah , ah , traffic police and emergency rescue personnel rushed to the scene , ah , to direct traffic and carry out emergency repair of sewage pipes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north - south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O
All personnel responsible for the emergency repair of underground sewage pipes , ah , have arrived at their designated locations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
See , through this footage , we see , ah , this --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Okay , ah , , this emergency repair worker said that he was there at 4 o'clock .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
That means that they arrived at the scene right after the pre-dawn accident occurred .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , it can be said that the traffic administration department was activated very quickly after receiving the news .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , ah , Yang Yang , you work at Traffic Radio Station , ha , well , and we know that you all gave an extensive live broadcast this morning .|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A special program .|||O O O O
Yes , a special program on this traffic .|||O O O O O O O O O
So , let 's first turn our attention to the impact on traffic after the accident .|||O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Judging from the traffic control measures taken after the accident , as well as the eventual impact caused , what do you think are the effects ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Actually , concerning this , I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Previously we had a statistic , especially for the ring roads in Beijing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
That is , if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road , it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper - to - bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road .|||O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O
Well , ah , if there is an accident , from the time it occurs until the time all traffic is cleared , it probably takes about half an hour to an hour during peak periods .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O
Well , we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge , blocking the main and side roads .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O
Well , the situation would be unthinkable during this peak period that is the first day of work for everyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
Hence , at that time , before 6:30 a .m . today , before our live broadcast , we moved the broadcast forward , and before the live broadcast we were very worried .|||O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , actually after the entire day today , I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here , in fact , in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control , and indeed there was a very big traffic jam .|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
However , the affected area was not as large as expected .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , some people made detours once they received the news .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Psychologically , people felt quite relieved .|||O O O O O O O
Because I know this situation .|||O O O O O O
Right , like those whom we interviewed just now .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It was easy to handle once everyone understood .|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes , ah , , a citizen , he said , I set out today before the incident , and I did not drive after I was informed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That person did not even drive .|||O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Actually , in this aspect , I think that citizens were really quite cooperative .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , this evening , we , received an SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
A friend said , I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge , ah .|||O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O
We were discussing that we could go home in fewer cars since everyone was on the same route .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Later on , we suggested to him and said , you , ah , might as well take the subway , because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O
Right .|||O O
Hey , he said this was quite a good idea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Actually , I think everyone was quite cooperative and also quite supportive in this aspect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , many , viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar , ah , with this road section we just mentioned , where , ah , the accident occurred .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , we can take a look later through an animation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road , with problems on both the main and side roads .|||O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , Chaoyang Road is an intersection .|||O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east - west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south - north direction , as we can see from this diagram , it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic , especially during commuting times .|||O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east - west direction .|||O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
When people living in the west want to cross over from the city , they have to go via this road .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence , if a traffic accident occurs at this place , we can indeed imagine , ha , how widespread , ah , the extent of the impact will be , such as the number of cars caught in traffic jams .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O
Yes .|||O O
As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently , right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident , ah , the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted .|||O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Well , I think that perhaps many friends in other places are wondering how one place is able to accommodate 32 commuter routes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
If the accident did not happen , perhaps everyone would not know that this place could normally have so many --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is really like this , just look at the bus signs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Have not seen so many buses .|||O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
Its effect on people has been extremely extensive .|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Well , what measures did the traffic control department eventually take to direct traffic ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our correspondent specially interviewed Director Meng Xianlong , Mr. Meng Xianlong , of the Command Center of the Beijing Municipal Traffic Administration .|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Let 's hear what Director Meng said .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O
Um , our traffic control department immediately activated the traffic emergency response plan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the roads close to where the problem emerged , we first set up traffic diversion points for traffic control at the southern and northern ends .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this way , all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides .|||O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south .|||B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
In order to ensure smooth traffic in the eastern district , we formulated a set of traffic diversion control plans .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road , East Fourth Ring Road , West Dawang Road , ah , and related roads to the east and west , and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic .|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
It can be said that measures were very promptly taken .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , today is the first workday after the New Year holiday .|||O O B-DATE O O B-ORDINAL O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT O O
Well , what exactly was the situation this morning ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
We specially sent a reporter to the scene this morning to shoot some footage .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O
Let 's take a look at the situation this morning through this footage .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , from this footage , we can see that , ha , at East Third Ring Road , ah , near Guanghua Bridge , the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and , well , various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees , the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic , ah , and guide drivers in making detours .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , since direction of traffic was carried out on the periphery , the number of vehicles at the section of the accident was significantly less than usual , with road traffic very orderly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , it can be said , ah , Yang Yang , citizens , regardless of whether they took the bus or drove , their mentality , in terms of being understanding or calm , ah , was a very important factor in having orderly traffic at the scene .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Right , right .|||O O O O
, through your listeners , what kind of feedback did you find out from them ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Actually , this morning , some listeners , ah , also happened to tell us about it via mobile phone SMS .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district , well there are many office buildings , ah , a lot of them , as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work .|||O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O
Therefore , they sent SMS saying , hey , it is unusual , ah , for me to be walking to the bus station today or going to take the bus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O
Well , it is unusual for me to enjoy a very pleasant morning .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We then reminded everyone to wear extra clothing .|||O O O O O O O O O
This shows that when people encounter such kind of emergency , they have started to be able to face it with a very calm and pleasant state of mind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that this mentality in facing emergencies , in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past , and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , I think it can also fully show the level of people 's satisfaction with emergency mechanisms of the operational departments of the government in handling this incident .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is , they think that the government has tried its best .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , in this respect , we citizens should also contribute our efforts .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
As such , in this regard , I think people 's mentality can become very calm .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Well , Professor Zhou , from this perspective , is this one highly positive effect achieved after information was disclosed ?|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
In terms of citizens ' mentality .|||O O O O O O O
Yes , in fact it can be seen from this particular case .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is , when the government was handling this kind of public emergency , well , it went from a traditionally unilateral administrative management method , well , a method in which information was quite delayed , to disclosure and transparency of information , and very fast as well .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We know that in the past , disclosure of information had to be reported to higher authorities , level by level , until the highest authorities had given approval , before information could be disclosed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Time was lost .|||O O O O
Well , yes , the State Council has , er , put forth a regulation concerning the establishment of public early warning mechanisms .|||O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is , related information that can be publicized will be publicized first , in order to guide people in what to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
In this way , related interaction between the government and the people can be formed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is , in modern public management , ah , this is a very good case , that is , of shifting from a kind of unilateral administrative management to public management and to positive interaction between the government and the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think in fact , we can sum up many beneficial experiences from this case and actually extend them to other areas .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , this is when we look at this case from the perspective of traffic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Traffic was the first thing to be impacted when this , cave - in accident occurred .|||O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , this accident actually involved many underground pipes , such as sewage pipes , ah , or water , ah , and gas , ah , pipes , that affect the lives of citizens in many other aspects .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Yang Yang , do you know how many pipes there are underground ?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Right now , there should be seven main types of pipes buried underground .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They include those like you just mentioned , as well as pipes like those for heating and communication , among others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Truly , these pipes are closely linked to the lives of citizens .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Closely linked .|||O O O
Yes , therefore besides our attention to the traffic issue just now , people are also very concerned , ah , with the situation after the accident , with other aspects affecting citizens ' lives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's take a look again at this footage of the situation of dealing with the current scene .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , according to our understanding of the situation , the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission , ah , the Communication Commission , ah , and telecommunication , traffic , and other departments have assigned personnel to participate in emergency repair work .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Relevant departments said that they will adopt a full range of measures to minimize the level of impact on people 's daily lives and work , in order to ensure stable order in society during the recovery period .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , looking at the government 's response to this cave - in accident , ah , we should say it was very prompt with traffic management and emergency repair , ah , because it involved various aspects of life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , ah , Professor Zhou , as this incident involved many departments after it took place , how do you think the various departments should coordinate between themselves ?|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
This is also --|||O O O O
It is not the case that this problem will be totally solved when one department shows up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I think as we build this kind , er , of public , this kind of emergency mechanism for public incidents , ah , has been the , most difficult to resolve , an actual problem that has been the most difficult to resolve among administrative management reforms in various countries .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How many groups of people will be sent ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Many groups .|||O O O
Yes , this is because social management requires division of labor in society .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is necessarily a labor division trend that involves many departments , and in addition , a kind of modern management public administration model which is diversified .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
How can cooperation be formed between departments in this kind of situation ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , sometimes under normal circumstances , sometimes , we often feel that it is very difficult for departments to cooperate with one another .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , there are too many law enforcement departments and , ah , too many administrative departments , and very often in the end , they are unable to coordinate .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , this time , through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time , ah , it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality , as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms , played a great role .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence , I think this was also a kind of , er , trial of interdepartmental cooperation mechanisms .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
It was a very successful , er , response .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I think many good things can be summed up from this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Yang Yang , based on your understanding , ah , as pipes that directly affect many common people 's lives were damaged after the accident , based on your understanding of the situation , how was remedial work carried out ?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , it is very cold during winter in Beijing , and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
Er , heating pipes were indeed damaged .|||O O O O O O O O
Well , at the time , it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O B-GPE O
Well , , in this regard , the Chaoyang district government did a very good job .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
After it , er , received this order from the municipal government , it immediately sent , electric heaters to residents in more than 200 households within this area .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O
It should be said that many residents spent quite a warm night at home yesterday .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
Well , furthermore , in the emergency repair process , ah , it should be said that the heating pipeline was restored relatively quickly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence , over here , I think the municipal government , ah , including sub-district offices , made a lot of effort to take good care of resident households .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think it was done in a very humanitarian manner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Professor Zhou , actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people , ah , for such a big city , a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
I think it should be unexpected yet at the same time within expectations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , we see that other , er , domestic and overseas cities have experienced similar incidents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps many overseas cities have had such kind of thing before .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is because a city is a gathering place for modern life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is a highly civilized place , as well as , however , in fact a gathering point for various conflicts , social , economic , security , various aspects of conflict .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence it is not at all surprising for such an accident to occur .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The critical thing is --|||O O O O O
But the critical thing is how emergency plans are activated after the occurrence of such accidents , and for a city , this is a test of its response capabilities .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Yes .|||O O
Yes , I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years , such as SARS , the snowfall a few years ago , the heavy rains two years ago , and the road cave - in at East Third Ring Road this time , I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality 's response capabilities continued to improve each time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
It can be said that this time , what was done has received favorable comments from everyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , well , I think , Yang Yang , perhaps you have stronger feelings on this aspect , ah .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Because you often have this kind of direct SMS exchange with listeners .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is because , we , Beijing Traffic Radio Station , has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing .|||O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Well , Beijing Traffic Radio Station is to be activated as a media for emergency plans that are grade three and above .|||O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
Well , for instance , as people still vividly remember , at the time of that snowfall just mentioned by Professor Zhou that people still vividly remember , there were no plans .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan .|||B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O
Well , at that time , it happened that I was hosting the Unblocked All the Way program in the studio that evening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
Well , at that time , traffic was not at all unblocked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , at that time there was none of this kind of interaction .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was not clear , it was very congested .|||O O O O O O O O O O
You sat inside the studio and only knew about the heavy snowfall .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You could find out other news only by telephone .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The various methods and channels were extremely unclear .|||O O O O O O O O O
Well , later , when we experienced that rainfall in Beijing , that rainfall two years ago , as well as some days of sand storms , all channels and early warning mechanisms were activated in quite an orderly manner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
From our perspective as media , I think it was precisely by going through those breaking - in , trials that we could be so calm in handling such an emergency today , ah , and give everyone the most effective announcements and notifications , and instructions .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , therefore , as a local media in this city , it should become a proactive participant when there is a public emergency in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
It should play its individual role in the process of resolving emergencies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , apart from this , Professor Zhou , what do you think are the areas for improvement for a city , especially a booming city , when handling this kind of public emergency ?|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right , I think this gave us many revelations , ah .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
First , I think one that should be especially important is early warnings and forecasts .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is because currently , there are , ah , frequently various kinds of risks lurking in cities , ah .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Early warnings and forecasts .|||O O O O O
Yes , this kind of early warning and forecast mechanism .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
It is not only for , this kind of sudden road cave - in , it also includes , for instance , security incidents , ah , in our society , as well as natural disasters , ah , and including public health incidents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
That is , this kind of scientific early warning and forecast mechanism must be set up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
In this way , you can manage and resolve an abnormal situation by turning it into a normal situation , without evolving into a sudden public emergency .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
Another thing I want to say is that besides , ah , emergency response and speedy integration mechanisms , I think some corresponding improvements should be made to the release of information , incident investigation , ah , and the relevant post-incident , responsibility system .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact , , that is , we should say that the government already has quite a number of relevant systems in this respect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , we have an administrative investigation system for incidents of major responsibility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have regulations on investigation procedures for very major incidents , as well as others such as emergency response methods for handling public health incidents and public health emergencies , among others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is to say , we have many corresponding systems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the question is how city management , er , handles these various kinds of perhaps unpredictable cases .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since we are entering new circumstances of human living , circumstances that contain high risk and have an increasingly developed urbanized life , well , I think corresponding improvements should be made to the formation of a series of systems that includes scientific planning , early warning and forecast , emergency response , accident investigation , and accountability .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , well , based on your understanding of the situation , and from an international perspective , what are some better ways of urban management that are worthwhile for us to learn ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think , in comparison to China , we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their level of development is more advanced than ours .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Although the scale of our urbanization is currently expanding at a rate of 1 % per year , I think , with our economic development being relatively backward , we actually still have many aspects of urban management to learn from foreign countries .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , many of the pipes involved in this incident were basic infrastructure , public utilities industries .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With a background of liberalization , marketization , and privatization , how can the government strengthen supervision of public utilities industries ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How can a safe , assured system be established ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Well , we need to learn and manage this .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
For instance , regarding information disclosure , well , our speed of information disclosure this time was very fast .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , we still have a lot of work to do in making the information disclosure , er , system more standardized , that is , to really implement a system of levels of responsibility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , we also need to explore how cooperation mechanisms between departments execute cooperation under normal situations and , well , how departments should cooperate with one another under these kinds of public emergency circumstances .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , for some of our emergency contingency plans , well , ah , how will these emergency contingency plans withstand these tests ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We know that currently , many ministries and commissions , as well as people 's governments at the provincial level , along with those at municipal and district levels , have set up emergency contingency plans for public emergencies , but many of them have not been put to the test .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , how will they undergo testing ?|||O O O O O O O O
These also include some of our command and policy - making systems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , with the growth of urbanization and with more and more of such complicated issues , ah , I think there will be increasingly high requirements on the systems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is , development of future systems is one of the top current priorities .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How can we institutionalize our response mechanisms and make them into a system so as to ensure the lifestyle of people who live in such a large - scale city ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The State Council has proposed a public emergency contingency plan , called One Plan , Three Systems .|||B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
" One plan " refers to the contingency plan , and " three systems " refers to systems of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , I think we still have a lot of work to do in these three areas of organizations , mechanisms , and laws .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
Well , finally , let 's turn our attention to handling of the situation , ah , during the latter stages of the cave - in accident in Beijing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Traffic , ah , can be said to have been directed , and is basically under control now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , following this , repairs have to be made on this road section where the accident occurred , including for many pipes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , Yang Yang , based on your understanding , how long will it take ?|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that the time really depends on how the overall repair goes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is because exploration , assessment , and repair are carried out in succession .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , regarding this work progress , to repair this road section in the shortest time , um , this will depend on the work progress .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh-huh .|||O O
This is because repair is probably not a matter of repairing the road surface alone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is also an issue with many of the pipes below .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , the pipes below .|||O O O O O O
Right , as it is winter , we know that carrying out construction during winter , especially that which requires pouring concrete and then --|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , it is especially difficult for concrete to set during winter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , preparation mix for making it dry faster , has already been added .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But in the end , it requires time .|||O O O O O O O O O
Hence , it depends very much on factors like temperature .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Just now , you mentioned that there are many pipes , ah , for instance , there is a key heating pipeline .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first thing is to ensure that it is connected in time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
In addition , waste discharge is also very important .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Waste discharged has currently blocked this up .|||O O O O O O O O
Um , and , for instance , optical fibers , ah .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Er , right now , if the optical fibers break , people in many households will not be able to watch television .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
At present , we should not have a problem with watching television .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are not broken .|||O O O O O
It is just that , as the other pipes have to be repaired , the optical fibers have to be rearranged , to be hung up it seems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After that , or it seems that a few steel pipes have been added below to make it safer to walk across this section .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , let 's take water pipes as an example .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Because they were exposed , The water pipes were not --|||O O O O O O O O O O O
after that , yes , these were not damaged .|||O O O O O O O O O O
they were not damaged and this is quite normal .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Um , there is no problem with water supply .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Okay , well , today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave - in accident in Beijing Municipality .|||O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
At the same time , you have also analyzed , from a system perspective , how the government has reinforced emergency contingency plans to handle such public emergency cases .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Okay , thank you very much , Professor Zhou and Yang Yang , for coming to the studio to participate in our program .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thank you , both of you .|||O O O O O O O
Okay , dear viewers , that is all for today 's edition of Focus Today .|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
Thank you for watching .|||O O O O O
See you at the same time tomorrow .|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
Hello .|||O O

Even as the paper asked for the public 's support it was unable to answer its questions /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yeah maybe /.|||O O O
but not a full accounting /.|||O O O O O O
You know and if the whole bottom line of this mess is that the public has the right to know and that that 's what this is all about the public still does n't know a lot of things /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's still a lot of questions here /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Why was that waiver that Miller was apparently granted by uh Scooter Libby a year ago /-|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Why did it wait until she sat in jail for all that time before she actually took up on it /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Arianna Huffington the Times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that Judy Miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own WMD reporting was wrong and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on Valerie Plame two years ago Jill Abrahamson now the paper 's managing editor says No way /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
That did n't happen /.|||O O O O O
In other words there 's a dispute in the accounts /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Pretty candid stuff for a newspaper to publish about itself would n't you say /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well as Frank said there are many unanswered questions /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
And there are many very devastating eh comments and conclusions about Judy Miller as a journalist /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
I do n't think the Times had any choice though Howie . Because remember as a press reporter back on July twenty - seventh the turmoil in the newsroom has been going on for months about Judy Miller and the way the paper has decided to cover the story and the way they decided to present her as a martyr for the first amendment /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LAW I-LAW I-LAW O
And the main unanswered question here is why did Arthur Sulzberger the newspaper 's publisher allow Judy Miller to hijack the reporting of that story and the editorial policy on that story /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the similarities for the Jayson Blair case /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Remember after the Jayson Blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what happened . Especially about why is a major institution like the Times ignoring so many red flags /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
In the story one of things that we learn is that Bill Keller took Judy Miller off her WMD beat as one of his first personnel decisions when he took eh the reins as editor /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Alright /.|||O O
Well uh I agree there are some unanswered questions /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
but I 'm willing to give the Times a little more credit than you for at least attempting to answer uh many of the questions /.|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And Lucy Dalglish here 's the thing that jumped out at me in the story /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Judy Miller acknowledges that at Louis Libby 's request this is the Dick Cheney aide she agreed to refer to him and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former Hill aide because he had once worked on Capitol Hill /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O
Do you have a problem with that sort of thing /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought that was a little bit misleading /.|||O O O O O O O O O
And I thought it was odd /.|||O O O O O O O
I mean her justification was that well he had been a former Hill staffer /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O
Um but that was a strange request /.|||O O O O O O O O
and I think the agreement was strange /.|||O O O O O O O O
I 'll agree with you on that /.|||O O O O O O O O
Frank Sesno the Times was so hamstrung by its passionate embrace of this reporter who after all was facing jail did go to jail /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One can understand the emotions uh that were unleashed here /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and yet the editors discouraged stories on the CIA leak investigation and one time killed a piece written by a reporter about Scooter Libby /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Was that an abdication of journalistic responsibility /?|||O O O O O O O O
Maybe yeah maybe /.|||O O O O
I mean what it really shows Howie I think is just how difficult it is for news organizations to report on themselves /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know news organizations demand total transparency whether you 're General Motors or United States government /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O B-GPE I-GPE O O
We want access /.|||O O O O
We want explanation /.|||O O O O
We want full disclosure /.|||O O O O O
But it 's very difficult for them to do it themselves /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this case and the Times makes it very plain in their story today they really suffered /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O
They were behind on virtually every major aspect of the story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even when she went to jail /?|||O O O O O O O
Even when she went to jail and w- /.|||O O O O O O O O O
When she won release from jail /.|||O O O O O O O
Yeah at the point that she came out /.|||O O O O O O O O O
They did n't say that you know until she walked out /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the question and this is a very serious question it 's not answered in the article /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Were editorial higher - ups and were the corporate lawyers at the New York Times in some way leaning on suppressing and distorting the coverage from the news uh section /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Arianna Huffington uh in this lengthy piece this morning uh uh Judy Miller is quoted excuse me as saying that there was another source beside Scooter Libby that she dealt with on the Valerie Plame situation /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
She does n't recall who that source was looking at her notes and seeing the uh notation Valerie Flame /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
She got the name wrong /.|||O O O O O O
Do you buy this notion that she does n't recall who this other source was /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No of course not Howie /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O
In fact I think this is the major unanswered question /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't know who eh her source was when it comes to revealing the identity of Valerie Plame /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
And to say that she does not recall is really as convincing as having Woodward and Bernstein saying that they do not recall who Deep Throat was /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it /.|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
You know I do n't /-|||O O O O O O
Incidentally there was some questions uh that Judy Miller would not answer to her colleagues /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O
and she would n't share her notes with them although they 've been turned over to the special prosecutor /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lucy Dalglish the big news for me was Miller recounting what her lawyer Floyd Abrams had said to her about a conversation that he had with Joe Tate who was Scooter Libby 's lawyer /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Uh says um Floyd Abrams according to Miller 's account when I would n't give him Tate an assurance that you would exonerate Libby he said do n't go there /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Now Tate by the way tells the Times that that account is false and outrageous /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O
Does this help justify eh Judy Miller 's otherwise mysterious decision to go to jail and not accept the waiver of confidentiality that Scooter Libby offered and sit in jail for eighty - five days /?|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
N- you n- /.|||O O O O
you know I 've been talking to Judy off and on about this case for the last year /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
This was a very difficult decision /.|||O O O O O O O
and you know what this all comes down to is you keep your promises when you make a promise to a confidential source /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You 'll recall six or eight months ago Howie I was on the show and we were talking about you know did Russert and Kessler and all the rest of those guys did they break some trust by agreeing to testify and observing the waiver /?|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What I think this situation and the turmoil that is obviously going on at the Times right now points out is the fact that we have a major problem in this country /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's that reporters believe they need to keep their promises to their sources /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reporters will try to do whatever they can as long as the law allows them to protect those sources /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right /.|||O O
But these days um with the state of our law the fact that we do not have a federal shield law we have prosecutors and civil litigants going in there and interfering with the day to day operation of our newsrooms /.|||O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we just can tolerate this /.|||O O O O O O O
And we 're trying to /-|||O O O O O O
I think Lucy 's on to something here if I can just say Howie /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
And I think this is very important because this is an ugly case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And even people close to Judith Miller say this is not the one you 'd really like to go to the mat on /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
You 'd love to have a clear whistle blower case /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You 'd love to have a Pentagon papers case /.|||O O O O O O B-ORG O O O
You 'd love to have something where the well - being and the sanctity of the Republic you know hangs in the balance /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O
She did n't even report on this /.|||O O O O O O O O
But it does point out a very serious issue /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or do n't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
We 've got to figure this out /.|||O O O O O O O O
Well just to clarify uh she did ultimately uh testify about her confidential source /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The whole issue was how voluntary was the waiver of her promise to Scooter Libby offered and why was she able to accept after being in jail as opposed to before being in jail /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well exactly /.|||O O O
and you know what Howie /. /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O O
it 's really time for Lucy and other Judy Miller defenders to update her talking points because what Lucy just said just simply does not wash /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
The truth is that as Howie said she did testify /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
The truth is that it 's very clear from the stories today that she could 've asked uh Scooter Libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of that could have happened /.|||O O O O O O O
It did not happen because clearly Judy Miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the American public /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O

I think it 's very obvious from what Judy wrote today she is protecting somebody else /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-DATE O O O O O O
And one of the reasons that this negotiation took so long is that not only was she negotiating what she was going to say about Scooter Libby but you got to keep in mind I 'm a lawyer there were lawyers involved in this /.|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They had to negotiate with Patrick Fitzgerald what he would not talk about /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O
They also had to negotiate whether or not there would be any type of um uh uh obstruction charges connected with contacting /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Once you invoke the wrath or the extreme interest of a federal prosecutor you have to be very very careful /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You do n't mess with the Feds /.|||O O O O O O O O
It 's very clear in her story that she decided finally to testify because she got tired of jail because she was threatened with criminal contempt charges because she wanted to go out and now she 's saying admitting finally write a book /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All these things are there in black and white /.|||O O O O O O O O O O

Welcome back to Reliable Sources /.|||O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O
As the CIA leak investigation continued this week media folks did plenty of speculating with no evidence about the possible indictment of a certain top White House official who testified before the grand jury for the fourth time on Friday /.|||O O B-ORG O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O B-DATE O
Karl Rove his closest aide the number two man in the White House the man that has been called Bush 's brain /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
If he 's indicted and has to go it undermines the key source of this President 's public support his character /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If Rove gets indicted that could bring down the Bush administration I think /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
My understanding from talking to somebody quite close to this investigation is that they think there are going to be indictments /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and possibly Karl Rove could be among them /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
Lucy Dalglish if Karl Rove is indicted , if Karl Rove is indicted , what if he 's not indicted /?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
Is n't this the worst kind of journalistic speculation /?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
You know I think it 's always dangerous to speculate whether or not you 're really besmirching someone 's reputation . Although I 'm not sure you can do that with Karl Rove /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
But it uh is very very you know eh irre- /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I would prefer that people keep an eye on you know watching him testify and going in and out of the courthouse /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But uh will it bring down the administration /?|||O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know /.|||O O O O O
Ah eh I do n't know /.|||O O O O O O O
Well nobody knows /.|||O O O O
That 's the point /.|||O O O O O
Arianna Huffington I used to cover the justice department /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Not everybody who 's under investigation winds up getting indicted /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah but you certainly and you 're uh on a blog so maybe it 's a different standard have speculated about Rove 's fate as well /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
Well not just Rove though /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O
what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney 's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-GPE B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O
I mean that is really the web /.|||O O O O O O O O
But it seems and we find out today also from uh um the reporting on the Miller story , that uh Fitzgerald is after Cheney even in some of the questioning eh of Miller /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
I think those were fairly routine questions about /.|||O O O O O O O O O
you have Judy Miller there /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
you ask about Cheney /. /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O
He was being thorough /.|||O O O O O
I think we 're overthinking this whole thing /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Karl Rove and this speculation business you know /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O

Pat Fitzgerald /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON
It 's very easy to sit here and say oh we should never speculate in journalism /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's irresponsible journalism /.|||O O O O O
It 's really how you speculate not that you speculate /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The fact of the matter is that Karl Rove has been to the grand jury four times /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they 're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It would be irresponsible I think for the media not to reflect what the discussion is here in town /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And there are plenty of Republicans mostly Republicans who are worried about this /.|||O O O O O B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O O O
Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush 's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's take a look at the actual footage /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam 's hometown how are they reacting to this political process /?|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-GPE B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O
Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Sir in north central Iraq voter regis- /-|||O O O O B-GPE O O O
Are you stunned /?|||O O O O
Are you stunned /?|||O O O O
Shocked /.|||O O
I ca n't believe it /.|||O O O O O O
they rehearsed it /.|||O O O O
They rehearsed it /.|||O O O O
They rehearsed it /.|||O O O O
Yeah you know something /?|||O O O O O
uh I remember a long time ago Michael Deaver the ultimate image meister for Ronald Reagan said my job is to light the President well and for everything I do to put the President in a good light /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now look first of all this is uncomfortable to see /.|||O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O
and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
But the fact that anybody would think that you would do something like this a remote /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean anybody in television will tell you that 's complicated business /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You have satellite delay /.|||O O O O O
You have a half a dozen people sitting there /.|||O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O
Who 's going to speak when /.|||O O O O O O O
You do n't want awkward silences /.|||O O O O O O O
You 're going to walk through it /.|||O O O O O O O O
so that it happened does n't surprise me /.|||O O O O O O O O O
That it hurts the President yeah that 's inevitable too /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Arianna Huffington does the staging here surprise you at all /?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
Well it 's not the question of surpising me Howie /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
It 's the fact that we are talking about war /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This is not just any photo opportunity /.|||O O O O O O O O
Of course that 's part and parcel of the presidency /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But we 're talking about a war in which almost two thousand young Americans have died /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O B-NORP O O O
And we are also using soldiers as props /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes it is shocking /.|||O O O O O
and I think Keith Olbermann did a phenomenal job at exposing this on MSNBC /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
Alright /.|||O O
And I think more and more journalists are actually taking a hard look at what this administration is doing /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
to give that order to the director because that 's the order that I got and then to do nothing to assist and facilitate that investigation in fact to undermine it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Clinton people were furious at the way Sixty Minutes hailed the segment /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O
and here to talk back is former Clinton White House attorney Lanny Davis /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON B-ORG I-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Welcome /.|||O O
Let 's deal with the substance first /.|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O
Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety - eight , he did n't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well not only is that false and President Clinton has said so but everybody who attended the meeting not including Louis Freeh says it 's false /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
And my problem with Sixty Minutes is that they never called anybody at the meeting /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Until Friday afternoon we did n't even know the charge was being made /.|||O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O
And even then they were unwilling to put somebody on the air to contradict Mister Freeh /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Sixty Minutes says Bill Clinton was offered a chance to come on and give his rebuttal /.|||B-ORG I-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
What 's wrong with that /?|||O O O O O O
Well first of all it 's absolutely amazing that Sixty Minutes thinks it 's okay to air a false and malicious statement /.|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a terrible charge that an FBI investigation was thwarted because President Clinton wanted to receive money for his library /.|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
The charge was false /.|||O O O O O
and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
What about anybody at the meeting who was willing to be on /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What about them doing reporting themselves before they air a false and demonstrably false charge /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's my problem /.|||O O O O O
What about Sandy Berger the former national security advisor under President Clinton /?|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
He was at the meeting /.|||O O O O O O
He was in the room /.|||O O O O O O
Did you offer him for an on - camera interview /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Well on Friday afternoon /.|||O O B-TIME I-TIME O
You were n't there /.|||O O O O O
I was not there /.|||O O O O O
You 're good on television /.|||O O O O O O
but you were n't there /.|||O O O O O O
uh I talked to Sandy Berger /.|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
We issued a statement from Mister Berger /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O
but this was Friday afternoon when we first learned about it with Sunday broadcast /.|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O B-ORDINAL O O O O B-DATE O O
Why did n't Sixty Minutes invite Mister Berger or other people at the meeting before Friday afternoon /?|||O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
Why did it take us to get Sixty Minutes to do basic reporting to verify facts /?|||O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O
It 's not enough to have Louis Freeh say something is so based on an anonymous source /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
That 's poor journalism /.|||O O O O O
On that point let me read a statement from a Sixty Minutes spokesman /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O
And this involves uh their saying that they contacted Clinton 's office back in August with a detailed list of charges and then quote in subsequent phone calls the President 's people said he did not want to be interviewed /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They gave no +substantive response to any of the allegations until Lanny Davis launched his PR campaign on the Thursday before the broadcast and offered himself as the person from the camp who would merely disparage and attack Freeh rather than deal with his allegations /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Denials from President Clinton and Sandy Berger that did deal with Freeh 's allegations were included in the Sixty Minutes report /.|||O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O
Well first of all it 's false to say that I was asking to disparage Freeh /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
I was asking to talk about facts that Freeh was saying that were not true /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
You do n't mind disparaging Freeh /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O
my observation /.|||O O O
no in fact I disparage any man who as FBI director has a personal pique rather than doing his job /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's disparaging /.|||O O O O
Secondly it is absolutely a misrepresentation that they told us before just the week before /.|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
When Mister Carson the representative spoke to Mister Wallace Mister Wallace agreed that they had never verified what Mister uh Freeh had said /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
They never talked to Mister Freeh /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON O
and in fact it was n't until that Friday that we learned the substance of Mister Freeh 's charges /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
So Sixty Minutes I think has just said something that is false /.|||O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O
When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton 's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O
When somebody named Howard Kurtz wrote a story in the Washington Post on Friday morning is the first time that the Clinton forces learned about that false and demonstrably false charge that good reporting by calling people who were at the meeting could have done would have verified that Mister Freeh made a false charge /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-TIME I-TIME O O B-ORDINAL O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
And even since that interview Mister Freeh has backed off and has not told people who his source is /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and he has n't even insisted that it was true /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He just said somebody told him it was true /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Hold on /.|||O O O
Sixty Minutes spokesman Kevin Tedesco said in the statement I just referred to that the Clinton office was contacted in August with a detailed list of charges /.|||B-ORG I-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O
That 's false /.|||O O O O
Are you saying that 's false /?|||O O O O O O O
They were never told /. /.|||O O O O O O
or at least I 'm now basing this on what Mister Carson has told me /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
Jay Carson is the spokesman for former president Bill Clinton /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O
President Clinton at that uh meeting did press the uh Crown Prince to cooperate with the FBI /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
so what Mister Freeh said was false /.|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O
That was not understood by the Clinton people until it was read in the Washington Post in the story that you wrote because Sixty Minutes put a press release out /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O
Uh now look Lanny Davis Sixty Minutes gave Bill Clinton one hour last year to push his own ten million dollar autobiography /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-ORG I-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-TIME I-TIME B-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O
He criticized people /.|||O O O O
He criticized Ken Starr /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
They did n't have Ken Starr on to rebut /.|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
Now the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation uh who ca n't stand Clinton clearly writes a book gets one segment for his book /.|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
and you cry foul /.|||O O O O O
Nobody was complaining about when Bill Clinton was getting all this airtime on CBS /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-ORG O
Look /.|||O O
Look this is a program about good journalism /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Let 's ask a Sixty Minutes uh journalist to say do you have an obligation to verify a charge made by the former FBI director as whether it 's true or not /.|||O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O
Is it good enough to air it just because he says it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or should you do reporting /?|||O O O O O O
Good reporters would hear that charge and say that is an extremely serious charge to be levelled against former president Clinton /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Let 's see whether it 's true and start making phone calls /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not do that /.|||O O O O O O
That 's a fact /.|||O O O O O

Our new time for those of you just turning in is ten AM eastern seven on the west coast /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME B-TIME O O O O O
And we 'll be bringing you a full hour of media interviews and analysis each week /.|||O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
The Iraq story which the media has placed on the back burner in recent months is simmering again as voters in that war torn country went to the polls yesterday to vote on a new constitution with the results yet to be counted /.|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But are journalists getting the real story there /?|||O O O O O O O O O
To help us scrutinize the coverage I sat down with a foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times three time Pulitzer winner Tom Friedman and the author most recently of The World is Flat /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-CARDINAL O B-WORK_OF_ART O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O
Tom Friedman welcome /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Good to be here Howie /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O
thank you /.|||O O O
The other day you wrote that if you were the editor of the New York Times you would 've led the paper with the news of recent days that a Sunni suicide bomber on Ramadan had attacked a Shiite mosque /.|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O B-DATE O O O B-NORP O O
Now in reality the world that you do n't rule New York Times Washington Post made that part of a larger story on Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Uh nobody put it on the front page /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Bad news judgement /?|||O O O O
Uh I think so Howie /.|||O O O O B-PERSON O
I 'm not here to make a news point though /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm really making a larger point which is about the war on terrorism /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm a firm believer /.|||O O O O O O
How we ever going to win this war /?|||O O O O O O O O O
We 're never going to win it by way of American intelligence finding this terrorist or that terrorist /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
We get lucky every once in a while /.|||O O O O O O O O O
but there 's only {one?} way we win this war Howie is it takes a village /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
It only happens when the Sunni Muslim world basically turns people in and when the Sunni Muslim world restrains their own /.|||O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O
And what was so shocking to me about this story a Sunni Jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of Ramadan /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
What that tells you is that there 's no controlling moral authority today in the Sunni Muslim world /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O B-NORP I-NORP O O
Well what is the bigger story /?|||O O O O O O O
And that is a huge story /.|||O O O O O O O
I think it should have been a big story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Why was n't /-|||O O O O
Is it because of Iraq fatigue /?|||O O O O B-GPE O O
Um /.|||O O
I think it is yeah /.|||O O O O O O
Think it 's /-|||O O O O
Are all the editors and producers and new executives feeling another day another bombing ten killed twenty killed fifteen killed /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O
and it does n't rise anymore to the top of the newscast or the front page /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right /.|||O O
Yeah and I think that 's right /.|||O O O O O O O O
There is Iraq fatigue /.|||O O B-GPE O O
And there 's so much fatigue that we do n't sit back and say wait a minute /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
what happened today /?|||O O B-DATE O
A Sunni Muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of Ramadan their holiest day /.|||O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O
and no one says boo /.|||O O O O O O
this is civilization that when we accidentally or deliberately I do n't know abused the Koran people rioted in Pakistan /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O O O B-GPE O
Yet their own houses of worship and holidays are being defiled /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I think it is a measure of how much we 've kind of lost been numbed by all of this that we do n't sit back and say wow wait a minute /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
that really crosses the line /.|||O O O O O O
and we have to call them on it even if they do n't /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You 're recently back from Iraq /.|||O O O O O B-GPE O
and you write about driving in from Kuwait /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O
You were guarded by the US navy /.|||O O O O O B-GPE O O
and yet it was kind of a harrowing experience /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Why so /?|||O O O
Um you know the south of Iraq which is where I was the area around /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
This is the safe part /.|||O O O O O O
Right exactly /.|||O O O
I was in the safe district /.|||O O O O O O O
I was guarded uh by the British Royal Marines actually because unfortunately they 've had now um uh roadside bombs down there not suicide bombs /.|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it 's part of the general continuing insecurity of Iraq that um I 'm afraid has plagued this story from the very beginning /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it 's been I 've always felt the Achille 's heel /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O
You know my criticism of the Bush administration as you know we 've talked about this before is not that this war is not important /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe it is important much more important than I think the left has ever fully recognized /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it 's so much harder than the right has ever been willing to acknowledge /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And on that trip you put on body armor /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
their rifles were out /.|||O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
Um how does that affect your perception as a journalist /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You 're there /.|||O O O O
you 're being protected /.|||O O O O O
and you must have been a little bit nervous of what the safety situation is in there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I 'll tell you what 's really frustrating from a journalist 's point of view as one who have lived in Beirut for nearly five years covered that war /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O
When I worked in Lebanon you could go anywhere on that story /.|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
You could cross lines /.|||O O O O O
Journalists worked for the most part until the very end with Terry Anderson the kidnappings targets /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
Therefore by the end of the Lebanon story I thought the best journalists there knew more than the Lebanese /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O
I always thought the best compliment you could get as a journalist is when you told the Lebanese something they did n't know because you were moving around so much /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What 's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird 's eye view /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
I care passionately about this story /.|||O O O O O O O
I 'm so interested in it /.|||O O O O O O O
but because of the securtiy situation you ca n't move around with the freedom you want /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the brave reporters who are there every day do n't have that freedom of movement either /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O
And therefore it 's limited /.|||O O O O O O
and in fact as you know the administration says because of the security situation and maybe because of some biases in the media /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's a lot of good things going on in Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
There 's a lot of progress being made we 're not seeing reported by the press /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you think that is a credible argument at this point in the mess there /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No because I do n't have a bird 's eye view /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wish I could say /.|||O O O O O O
I wish I could be so sure /.|||O O O O O O O O
but General Casey does n't have a bird 's eye view /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
And that 's why we get surprises in Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Uh that 's why we had an election where eight million people suddenly turn out /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O
and maybe you know we 're going to see more surpises in the coming future there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But because no one can move around with the freedom that you need to talk to everyone you do n't have that bird 's eye view /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And as a reporter as a columnist who really cares about this story I find that really frustra- /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I can not report it the way I 'd love to /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I 've been there five times /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
but it 's episodic /.|||O O O O O
It 's here /.|||O O O O
It 's there /.|||O O O O
It 's never really putting your arms around the story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-EVENT O B-EVENT O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-GPE O O
Um inevitable with a war that drags on and on /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and these are all also important stories obviously /.|||O O O O O O O O O
but uh do you feel it 's getting the attention that it should /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
No because to me this is the whole ballgame of the Bush administration /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
Katrina and Rita they 'll come and go /.|||B-EVENT O B-EVENT O O O O O O
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
If that happens then I think President Bush is going to have a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um if it does n't happen I think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the American people /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
These are huge stakes involved /.|||O O O O O O
And so I do n't think it 's gotten the attention it 's deserved /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict /.|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The slightly ragged quality left you feeling you write that if you pulled the US and British advisors out tomorrow the whole Iraqi navy would collapse /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-NORP O O B-DATE O O B-NORP O O O O
That 's a pretty pessimistic assessment and clearly at odds with what the White House and the Defense Department say every day /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-DATE I-DATE O
/.|||O
Not at odds though with what actually the military commanders have been saying which is that the number of really trained Iraqi units you know are far fewer than sometimes suggested by the administration /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So you 're saying there 's a gap between what real time military commanders on the ground are willing to tell you not necessarily on the record /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day /.|||O O B-CARDINAL B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
Are we calling them on that /?|||O O O O O O O
Right I do n't think enough because there 's been a lot of happy talk around this Howie basically /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
And a lot of numbers are thrown out /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Eighty thousand this week we 've got trained a hundred and twenty thousand next week /.|||B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-DATE I-DATE O
Here 's what you learn when you go to Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Where you have an Iraqi commander who 's a real leader of soldiers okay you have a unit /.|||O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And where you do n't have that commander you do n't have a unit /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the numbers the macro numbers do n't mean anything /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So I went down to see the navy there /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander /.|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O
so the people around him they 'll follow him into battle /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you take that one guy out there 's no Iraqi navy /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-NORP O O
and it 's true of units all over the country /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's really the key /.|||O O O O O O
You say that you are angry uh that Bush has fought the war as though it would be easy /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you particularly angry as somebody who supported the war and took heat from some of your liberal friends for doing so /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes /.|||O O
Absolutely because I believe this is important /.|||O O O O O O O O
I believe that something very big is at stake /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
We 're dealing with a Muslim Arab civilization right now that 's that 's in decline , that 's heading in the wrong direction in ways that are dangerous for them and I believe dangerous for the stability of the world /.|||O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's something really important here at stake /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and what makes me so angry at the Bush administration is not that they did n't frame the stakes /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
It is important /.|||O O O O
But they never never appreciated how difficult it was /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
They never prepared the army or the American people for how difficult it was /.|||O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O
I mentioned the uh devastating earthquake in Pakistan a region you 're familiar with /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Um clearly it 's become a pretty big story /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
but for the first couple days I noticed it was n't that much of a television story /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the reason was no pictures no video /.|||O O O O O O O O O
No yes /.|||O O O
Um but also maybe there was there a little bit less coverage because it 's in a remote part of the world /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh Westerners are more interested in New Orleans than in Pakistan /?|||O B-NORP O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O B-GPE O
I think all of the above /.|||O O O O O O O
We 're so numbed also after Katrina and Rita /.|||O O O O O O B-EVENT O B-EVENT O
and now another earthquake /.|||O O O O O
/.|||O
It 's just become uh one natural disaster after another /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
to hear ten thousand twenty thousand forty thousand then it 's almost hard for a journalist to process /.|||O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Right /.|||O O
And it was remote /.|||O O O O O
and people are exhausted I think both viewers and reporters /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Ahead have New York Times columnists been asked not to write about Judy Miller /?|||O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
More of my interview with Tom Friedman next /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Welcome back to Reliable Sources now a full hour each week here in our new time slot ten to eleven o'clock eastern /.|||O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
More now of my conversation with New York Times columnist Tom Friedman about his book the new online charge to read him and Judy Miller /.|||O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Now your new book The World is Flat I 've got it here /.|||O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O
uh monster best seller more than a million copies better than any book you 've ever written before /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Um you were recently profiled about this in Fortune magazine /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
and uh let 's just say that it did n't say you walked on water but it came close /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh but one of the criticisms /-|||O O O O O O O
What 's wrong with that /?|||O O O O O O
It says that you 're the composer of the nation 's talking points which was news to me /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh one of the things it said was that uh in your book and in your writing that CEOs play a very central role /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the suggestion was well CEOs love you , you 're asked to speak at all these corporate events , maybe because you give them a very large uh share of the narrative /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah /.|||O O
Mhm /.|||O O
Mhm /.|||O O
That a reasonable observation /?|||O O O O O
Yeah it is a reasonable observation /.|||O O O O O O O
And my reaction to that is look if I want to understand the underlying technology that is flattening the world who do I go to /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do I go to I do n't know Central America /?|||O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O
Do I go to um uh the factory floor /?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Or do I go to the innovators and entrepeneurs who actually put all this together /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I make no apology for that at all /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Um fact I would make a criticism of it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
There are n't enough people during the last few years who actually went out and talked to the innovators who are doing all of these things who are actually reshaping the world /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just the opposite /.|||O O O O
We kind of had an Enron effect /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O
and Enron effect was all CEOs are guilty unless proven innocent , therefore who wants to talk to them /?|||O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And therefore I would argue -- /.|||O O O O O O O
Wait a second /.|||O B-TIME I-TIME O
wait a second /.|||O B-TIME I-TIME O
Journalists uh subscribe to stereotypes because there are a few crooks at major corporations because you know they 're all bad guys /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah yeah /.|||O O O
Yeah I would say /.|||O O O O O
uh that 's a harsh uh assessment /.|||O O O O O O O O
I would say that there 's several things happened basically in the last three years /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
I would call it a perfect storm /.|||O O O O O O O O
One was nine eleven /.|||B-CARDINAL O B-EVENT I-EVENT O
That distracted us okay /.|||O O O O O
The other was the Enron effect /.|||O O O O B-ORG O O
You know no one wanted to be sort of seen with CEOs /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And number three was the dot com bust which made everyone think well all this globalization technology stuff is really over /.|||O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And as a result I would argue that really masked what is actually a fundemental inflection point the flattening of the world that we 're going from a vertical value creation model of command and control to a much more horizontal one of connect and collaborate /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The argument of this book is that that shift is actually going to have as big an effect over time as Gutenberg and the printing press /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
And I would argue a little bit that it got missed because of all these other distractions /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it 's only had an effect on Tom Friedman 's career /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
In fact you were the Playboy interview /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O
Hey put that paper down /.|||O O O O O O
/.|||O
I bought it for the articles /.|||O O O O O O O
Uh I enjoyed the interview /.|||O O O O O O
and you said in there that your wife uh edits all your columns and she says do n't publish it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes she does /.|||O O O O
You go back and rewrite it /.|||O O O O O O O
I 'm afraid I do /.|||O O O O O O
/.|||O
My wife Andrea edits them all /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O
and when she gives me thumbs down Howie I have to put it in a ball throw it in the circular file and start over /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and she 's a tough editor /.|||O O O O O O O
Now your international readership on the New York Times website has gone down because of this new experiment the Times has where it costs forty nine ninety - five a year for non-subscribers at home to read Times columnists /.|||O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
That 's got to be disappointing for you /.|||O O O O O O O O O
You know um I 'm torn /.|||O O O O O O O
Uh and I 've said this to my bosses /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Um I want my paper to thrive /.|||O O O O O O O O
and if we have a situation where young people grow up in the world that thinks that newspapers are things you read for free online who 's going to pay my travel expenses /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And at the same time one of the greatest things about New York Times online is I got to reach an audience that just was exponential to what you got in the dead tree edition of the New York Times /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
And because I write about international affairs so I got a lot of young people in India and Egypt and whatnot /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O
and for them fifty dollars that may be their tuition for half a year /.|||O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
So I 'm honestly torn /.|||O O O O O O
I really hope this works because I want the New York Times to have a platform that is sustainable /.|||O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O
But at the same time I hope we can eventually find a way to re-engage those people because definitely we 've lost some of them /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eh in the Valerie Plame leak investigation there 's an allegation bouncing around the blogosphere that I just thought I would address with you which is have New York Times columnists somehow been told not to write about this because of Judy Miller 's involvement and being in jail , now being out of jail /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O

the Chinese Government is sending tonight to a senior delegation /.|||O B-NORP O O O B-TIME O O O O O
And you know frankly we think it 's time for China to use its influence with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem /.|||O B-NORP O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward , to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they 've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago /.|||B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea /.|||O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution /?|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
If you look at this UN resolution that 's under debate in New York it does /.|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O
it 's a chapter seven resolution so it has the effect of compulsory behavior by all the member states /.|||O O O B-LAW I-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It says that what the North Koreans did was a threat to international peace and security /.|||O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
That strikes us as an obvious point /.|||O O O O O O O O
And I think what we have to do we 'll see a lot of diplomacy over the next couple of days /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
we 'll have to see how the Chinese and Russians react to this /.|||O O O O O O O B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O
but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia 's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O B-GPE I-GPE B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O
That 's certainly the best policy for the United States /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
Force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table /.|||O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O
there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
Here 's one Nicholas Burns on National Public Radio /.|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
With Iran the United States has made an offer /.|||O B-GPE B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O
and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Why not sit down in the same way with North Koreans Say to them stop developing your program /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O
and we 'll sit down with you one on one /.|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O
Well Tim we 're trying to sit down with the North Koreans in the context of the six party talks /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
We 've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks /.|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O
but we really do n't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O
The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States /.|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
It should have the same interest /.|||O O O O O O O
And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O
Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests /.|||O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O
and the Russians do as well /.|||O O B-NORP O O O O
And so we think we 're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O
I simply do n't see why it 's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O
We 're perfectly willing to sit down with them in that six party environment /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
and in that sense it 's analogous to what we 're trying to do with Iran /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Secretary Rice announced about a month ago that should the Iranians meet the condition of suspension of their own nuclear activities we 'd be willing to sit down in another multilateral forum /.|||O B-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's with the Europeans and Russians and Chinese /.|||O O O O O B-NORP O B-NORP O B-NORP O
So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States /.|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O
And the Asian countries want to be involved in these negotiations /.|||O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O
Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea /?|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
Well this is one of the most despotic regimes in the world /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
it 's a major human rights violator /.|||O O O O O O O O
There 's massive famine /.|||O O O O O
And certainly we hope for the day will come when those people will live in peace and be governed by a different type of government /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh what we 've got to do now of course is focus on the most immediate problem /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And that problem is nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O O O O
The problem is the ballistic launches of the other day /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
I think the thing to remember about those launches by the way they were provocative , they were reckless , they were also unsuccessful /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They fired four scud missiles intermediate range missiles /.|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
They tried to fire the longer range missile the /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
and that was spectacularly unsuccessful /.|||O O O O O O
It crashed in the sea of Japan /.|||O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O
So we obviously have an opportunity now for diplomacy . And an opportunity to use the combined strength of all these countries to provide some leverage put some leverage against the North Koreans /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O
and that 's what we will continue to try to do in the coming days and coming weeks /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE O
Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime /?|||O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you look back at this historic agreement that was signed in the six party frameworks on September nineteenth of two thousand five those types of assurances are in that agreement /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O
But the North Koreans have obligations /.|||O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O
and that is to take down their nuclear program dismantle it dismantle their weapons of mass destruction programs in a verifiable way before all those assurances can go into place /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the other elements of the agreement can be put into place /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And what we 've seen since then is we 've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
but we see the North Koreans walking away from it /.|||O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O
So we 've got to be very persistent and frankly very tough in combining with these other countries to pressure the North Koreans to live up to their commitments /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O
But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated /?|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The North Koreans know what 's in the September nineteenth agreement /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
and it 's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they 've got responsibilities in this agreement /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and no agreement is whole until both sides meet their agreement /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And what we 've seen Tim especially on July Fourth is the North Koreans in outright violation of the agreement that we made with them last September /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
Why do you think the North Koreans chose July Fourth /?|||O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O B-DATE I-DATE O
Oh I do n't think it was coincidental /.|||O O O O O O O O O
You know it 's a very unreliable and unpredictable regime /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The last thing we want to do is react to every wild statement that they make /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but they certainly chose that to get our attention and that of the international community /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh but what they 've got to realize is there is no magic bullet here /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They ca n't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O
That does n't work for Japan /.|||O O O O O B-GPE O
it does n't work with South Korea /.|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
and frankly it does n't work with the Chinese /.|||O O O O O O O O B-NORP O

he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister , we want to see China use its influence /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they 've made to all of us /.|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Speaker Newt Gingrich the former speaker Republican weighed in on this debate in this way /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O
he offered this /.|||O O O O
The time to replace the state department 's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever , act never has come /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat /.|||O B-DATE I-DATE B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O
For thirteen years the North Korean dictatorship has lied and hunkered down and continued to build nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles /.|||O B-DATE I-DATE O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The strategy of talking has failed /.|||O O O O O O O
America 's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little /.|||B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is acting in defiance of all its own international commitments /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the time for talk is over /.|||O O O O O O O O
either they dismantle the missile /.|||O O O O O O
or we the United States should dismantle it /.|||O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O
Well uh with all due respect to Speaker Gingrich we are on a course which has a reasonable chance of success /.|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you never want to disavow a diplomatic track a negotiating track if you think you can resolve the problem in that fashion /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And as I said before we are not alone in this endeavor /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we have countries united with us who can apply the same type of pressure /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will say this what the North Koreans have done over the past week is going to give a lot of strength in our efforts to develop a missile defense system /.|||O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You 've seen very strong statements by the Japanese government wanting to work with us in that realm /.|||O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
So obviously we 're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O
And I think you 'll see us move ahead smartly in that direction as well /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea 's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just has n't worked /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Here 's the latest study from the Institute for Science and International Security /.|||O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president /.|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O

The group 's assessment based on analysis of satellite imagery media reports and statements by North Korean officials which lead Nick Everstat a conservative critic from the American Enterprise Institute these are not Democrats /-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O B-NORP O
he offered this /.|||O O O O
although the Bush administration 's rhetoric about Kim Jong - Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea 's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-PERSON B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By more than one criteria indeed strategic successes on the Bush watch outshine those from its during the Clinton years /.|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-PERSON O
Tim um obviously we profoundly disagree with um some of the statements that we 've just heard /.|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eh you know we 've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O
And that military can handle any contingency that should arise /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We also have a very tough policy and I think forward looking policy to develop missile defense to handle those contingencies /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you 've got to combine military measures with diplomacy to be effective in a situation like this /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
We can do that by channeling those efforts through the six party framework /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
And you know diplomacy sometimes ca n't succeed in a day or two or a week or two /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Sometimes it takes many months or even years to succeed /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-DATE O O O
But if you have the right policy in place , if you know what you 're trying to accomplish and if you 're very tough - minded about applying that policy we can be successful /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So we have not given up hope that we can engineer a policy that will effectively put the North Koreans back in the box take away their nuclear programs and take away their ability to inflict threats and damage on their neighbors /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have got to be single - minded about this /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
but frankly I do n't think these critics have offered any alternative that would have a reasonable prospect of success or lead us to unintended consequences uh if you went down the road that some of them are suggesting /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we think we 've got the right policy in place /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I can assure you we 're going to drive with a great deal of energy and determination /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you do not deny that North Korea 's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush /?|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability /.|||O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O
and we believe that it has produced that over the last several years /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
and that 's why we 've put in place this policy designed to take it away from them /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if we can have the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement implemented it will do just that /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O
It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea /.|||O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
And so that is a good bet for the United States /.|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
It 's obviously the goal that I think all these critics that you cite would share /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But we think we 've got a much more realistic in the real world strategy put in place to deal with that problem /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But there has been a profound change in the rhetoric certainly of the President on this subject /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here 's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea /.|||O O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O
It takes a while for a problem to fester and grow /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then it takes a while to solve them diplomatically /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It just 's the nature of diplomacy /.|||O O O O O O O O
Wish we could solve them overnight /.|||O O O O O B-TIME O
And let me go back to January of two thousand two in the President 's axis of evil speech before congress /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
Let 's watch /.|||O O O O
North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens /.|||B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We 'll be deliberate /.|||O O O O O
yet time is not on our side /.|||O O O O O O O O
I will not wait on events while dangers gather /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The United States of America will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons /.|||B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O
And yet we 've driven forward with this policy designed to respond to all the things the President talked about back in two thousand two /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
But he has been very consistent since then in putting forward the proposition that we have to oppose the human rights abuses of the government /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 've done a lot to develop missile defense /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
And we 've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
So we have been very activist /.|||O O O O O O O
We have followed this policy for a number of years /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Uh the President is right /.|||O O O O O O
And as I said before diplomacy ca n't be measured in a snapshot /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You ca n't just say in a Sunday morning in July that somehow because we have n't come to the end of negotiations these negotiations are bound to fail /.|||O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You 've got to be very purposeful and directed in what you 're trying to do and apply the weight of your country and that of others to the test /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And that 's what we 're doing /.|||O O O O O O O O
We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
But again it 's the tone and the rhetoric /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong - Il of North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-GPE I-GPE O
I loathe Kim Jong - Il /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
I got a visceral reaction to this guy /.|||O O O O O O O O O
And then in two thousand four there 's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
And then this in two thousand two /.|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
the President called him a pygmy And compared him to a spoiled child at a dinner table /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Does the President still believe that Kim Jong - Il is a tyrant a pygmy and a spoiled child /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
Kim Jong - Il is a despot /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O
And he is someone who is one of the worst offenders of human rights all over the world /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh these missile tests the other day were certainly reckless /.|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O
They were provocative /.|||O O O O
And so uh we have n't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
No one in our government has /.|||O O O O O O O
We are very clear - eyed about who they are , what they represent , how much they 've denied their own people the basic human rights that people should have around the world /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we 're focused on this nuclear question as well /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So I think there 's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we 've talked about North Korea over the last several years /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
And uh we 're determined to press ahead /.|||O O O O O O O O O
When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE O
The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq /.|||B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O B-CARDINAL O O O B-GPE O
Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
And both of those countries have clearly miscalculated their own situation /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now the North Koreans felt I guess that by testing these ballistic missiles they would somehow put themselves in a position of greater weight in the negotiations /.|||O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 've miscalculated because you 've seen very tough statements from the Chinese and the Russians and the South Koreans and the Japanese against what they 've done /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-NORP O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O B-NORP O O O O O O
and you see momentum building in the UN security council toward a very tough chapter seven resolution against them /.|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-LAW I-LAW O O O O
The Iranians have miscalculated /.|||O B-NORP O O O
They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O B-NORP O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O
But we 've been able to craft a major and united coalition of all those countries /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we 've essentially given the Iranians a clear choice /.|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
And you 'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-LOC O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O
the Iranians are going to have to choose /.|||O B-NORP O O O O O O O
Negotiations with us after they suspend their nuclear programs or further action in the Security Council /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
So I do n't think either of these countries is on the offensive /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Frankly I think both of these countries are rather cornered and isolated /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are very few countries defending them /.|||O O O O O O O O
and they 're running out of options /.|||O O O O O O O O
So we think this policy of patient diplomacy and of crafting multilateral coalitions to tighten the pressure around them is going to work /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it 's the right way to go clearly for the United States /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
we want to exhaust diplomatic means before we consider other means /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation /.|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-ORG O O O O
the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you agree with that /?|||O O O O O O
I do n't /.|||O O O O
not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran /.|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-GPE O
Tim I 've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance /.|||B-PERSON O O O O B-LOC B-CARDINAL O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-NORP O O B-NORP O B-NORP O B-GPE O O O
There 's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who does n't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
There is n't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who does n't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O
There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O B-CARDINAL O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O
There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-NORP O O B-GPE O
In fact we are now tightly knit up with these countries /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if you look at what the French German and British governments are saying as well as the Russian and Chinese governments about whether or not these countries are intending to create a nuclear weapons capability they agree with our assessment /.|||O O O O O O O B-NORP B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I do n't agree at all that we 're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Let me conclude with comments by Bill Crystal the editor of Weekly Standard /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-ORG I-ORG O

I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
but I am worried that it has made them too passive in confronting the other threats /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options /?|||O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O

Uh the successes we 've had with the North Koreans have been through direct engagement When I got some pilots out of North Korea When Bob Gallucci negotiated the agreed framework /.|||O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
Secretary Albright close to having an agreement on reducing or terminating their missiles /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
What North Korea is seeing right now is Iran getting a nuclear reactor /.|||O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O
They see Iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives /.|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the United States /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
But also they want to see an effort by the United States to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't believe they do /.|||O O O O O O O
They are a desolate isolated regime /.|||O O O O O O O
But right now our policy is not working /.|||O O O O O O O O O
It makes sense to talk directly with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
But would n't the world then say oh I see /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
you test a missile on the fourth of July /.|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
you get the US attention /.|||O O O B-GPE O O
and you bring them to the bargaining table /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Our policy right now does not work /.|||O O O O O O O O
Look where we are right now /.|||O O O O O O O
Uh Asia is destabilized /.|||O B-LOC O O O
We are trying to outsource our foreign policy to China /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
I believe China is not necessarily interested in helping us on North Korea /.|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
They do n't want to see a bunch of refugees go into their country /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe that China is a competitor /.|||O O O B-GPE O O O O
They control a lot of our debt /.|||O O O O O O O O
Right now we do not have leverage over China /.|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
The best effort in my judgment is face to face talks /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hard negotiating /.|||O O O
Get that agreement that was uh signed in September that North Korea has not abided to /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O
A time table for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O
Efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we do n't attack North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
They get economic assistance /.|||O O O O O
But our objective should be firm /.|||O O O O O O O
To get them to dismantle their nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O O O O O O
The best way to do it is face to face talks /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the President now changed his course wo n't the headlines be Bush blinks /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
No /.|||O O
I believe the headlines would be Bush deals realistically with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
He reverses a policy that is not working /.|||O O O O O O O O O
Ambassador Gallucci do you agree with that /?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O
Just about entirely /.|||O O O O
uh I have nothing against the idea of the six party talks something Nick pounded on /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O B-PERSON O O O
Uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in Asia engaged that 's /-|||O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O
it 's true /.|||O O O O
it is their problem as well as ours /.|||O O O O O O O O O
But the fact is it has n't worked /.|||O O O O O O O O O
And to make the form more important than a substance To care more about whether we have six parties meeting together than whether we stop the accumulation of plutonium is absurd in my view /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You 'd have some conditions /.|||O O O O O O
you had said prior to the missile test that if they took that missile off the launch pad you 'd negotiate face to face /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now that they 've launched it would you have any conditions before you went back to the table one on one /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O
This is kind of a rule I think that you really try hard not to negotiate with a gun or missile to your head /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I think a decent interval now and some work at the United Nations is the appropriate thing to do /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O
But I think we 're taking a view from thirty thousand feet right now /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O
what should the administration do /?|||O O O O O O
It needs to find a way to get back to the negotiating table /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that 's not so bad if you find you 're on the wrong course /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and we have been /.|||O O O O O
Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US /?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-CARDINAL O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O B-GPE O
No I actually think the six party talks is a perfectly appropriate forum including for us to speak directly to the North Koreans if others are at the table /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O
Let 's go back to the logic of the six party talks in the first place /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O B-ORDINAL O O
The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O
And we do n't trade with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
we do n't recognize North Korea diplomatically /.|||O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O
uh there 's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
We 're capable of military action /.|||O O O O O O O
and it 's important that that be an ingredient of course in diplomacy /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the real levers on Kim Jong - Il are the Chinese and the South Koreans /.|||O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-NORP O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O
It is they who essentially support the regime economically and politically /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But makes sense to have them at the table /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
The six party talks I totally agree with my colleagues here have produced nothing so far except a quadrupling of the amount of plutonium as ambassador Richardson said um in North Korean hands and now missile launches /.|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O
So they 've been running wild for three years or so /.|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Um the reason for that /-|||O O O O O O
there 's a lot of blame to go around /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
you have to start with the North Koreans and their own intransigence /.|||O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O
The Chinese and the South Koreans have not done everything that they should /.|||O B-NORP O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O
uh they 've shown the carrots /.|||O O O O O O O
they 've been unwilling to show the sticks that they can also wield /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think on our side um it matters less who else is at the table than that we have our own wits about us as we sit down with the North Koreans /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O
And our government I believe has been divided over the last few years as the six party talks between two camps /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-CARDINAL O O O B-CARDINAL O O
One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea /.|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
But there 's another camp uh in this country and I think represented in the government that believes that negotiating with the North Koreans is a fools game or is even immoral because of the nature of the regime /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't agree with that view because I think it 's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
But we have been of two minds /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
and therefore I do n't think we at the table has been as effective as we might have been /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Though it 's important that we get our story straight /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and that 's more important than who else is at the table /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You had advocated several weeks ago a preemptive military strike on the missile that was about to be tested /.|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many criticize that as belligerent /.|||O O O O O O
and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan /.|||O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O B-GPE I-GPE O O B-GPE O
who knows /.|||O O O
In hindsight do you still stand by that preemptive military strike /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I do /.|||O O O O
and I want to put that in some context /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
By the way I would say we should have that same position today That is if the North Koreans go out to the launch pad and erect that missile and prepare to launch it we can destroy that uh before they can do it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To do so would be a very limited military action a single bomb a single cruise missile /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the north Koreans are n't going to start a war in response uh to that kind of action /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And to those that think that 's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
At some point we have to draw a line in the sand and defend it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We say things are intolerable /.|||O O O O O O
we say they 're unacceptable /.|||O O O O O O
and then we tolerate and accept /.|||O O O O O O O
former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and I thought long and hard about this /.|||O O O B-ORG B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
and we thought that this was a relatively nonprovocative way to draw a line in the sand with North Koreans /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O
Now I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction also /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
you may say there 's risk in this action /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
but I have to emphasize there 's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O
Governor Richardson well how do you think the North Koreans would react if we took out their test missile /?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
Well I respectfully disagree with Assistant Secretary Carter there /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
But at least he 's got a new idea which the administration does not put forth /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened , that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan /. /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE O O
Uh you do take that step /.|||O O O O O O O
but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
and we 've got thirty seven thousand American forces at the DMZ /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-NORP O O O O O
Uh but Tim I think another reason for the face to face talks is that there 're two issues that are separate from the six party talks that are a serious grievance in our relationship /.|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
one is the fact that we have frozen financial assets of the North Koreans /.|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O
I believe rightly so /.|||O O O O O
but that is a separate bilateral issue /.|||O O O O O O O O
The second is our objection to dealing with North Koreans ' request for a light water reactor Which I believe has bogged down the six party talks /.|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
So you ca n't cut them out /.|||O O O O O O O O
but I think it 's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O
But in the end it 's a judgment of North Korean intentions /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O
You 'd been there five times /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
you know them /.|||O O O O
and yet a few weeks before the missile launch you said I do n't think they 're going to test /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they did /.|||O O O O
No Tim I said I believe that they were going to test /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
I did say that /.|||O O O O O
And what I sense in my negotiations in dealing with North Koreans /-|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O
You said as days go by I do n't believe they 're going to do it /.|||O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But early on I said that they did on CBS /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you 're not dealing with individuals like you and me /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't believe in compromise /.|||O O O O O O
they believe in their only way or the highway /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Their view is that their cause is right /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and they 're going to wait you out /.|||O O O O O O O O O
So they 're totally unpredictable /.|||O O O O O O
and I believe the only way to deal with them and we have shown that effectively in past dealings with the Clinton Administration is direct engagement To get them to curb their nuclear weapons as Bob Gallucci did /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
Secretary Albright almost got a missile agreement /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O
Uh Jimmy Carter got uh an agreement which was later violated regrettably with the father Kim Jong - Il /.|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor /.|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O
the continuation of the six party talks is the best way to go /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
But do they keep their word /?|||O O O O O O O
Here 's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong - Il in North Korea October of two thousand /.|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-GPE I-GPE B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
She appeared on this program four years later /.|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
and this was our exchange /.|||O O O O O O
But did n't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton 's watch /?|||O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
No what they were doing uh as it turns out , they were cheating /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and the reason that you have arms control agreements is that you do n't make them with your friends , you make them with your enemies /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it is the process that is required to hold uh countries accountable /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ambassador Gallucci you negotiated that ninety four agreement /.|||O B-PERSON O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
The North Koreans stopped processing in one plant if you will /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
but we later found out that at the same time they were making uranium in another plant /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not actually /.|||O O O
No that 's not what we found out /.|||O O O O O O O O O
What happened was we did do a deal /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We did stop a uh plutonium based pro-nuclear weapons program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We made sure that eight thousand fuel rods containing around thirty kilograms enough for five nuclear weapons worth of plutonium stayed in a storage pond /.|||O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
And the deal would have had the North Koreans end their nuclear weapons program /.|||O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O
We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan /.|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-GPE O
We do n't know a lot about that where it is whether the equipment has been put together /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We think over a period of time they 'll do what the Pakistanis did , what the Iranians appear to be wanting to do and put together this gas centrifuge /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they never got there yet /.|||O O O O O O O
Or we do n't think they 've gotten there yet /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But they broke their word /.|||O O O O O O
They absolutely cheated /.|||O O O O
There 's no question about that /.|||O O O O O O O
But really you ought to be clear here what 's happened /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a nuclear weapons program that was stopped /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
Plutonium production was stopped /.|||O O O O O
Right /.|||O O
And afterwards tragically I believe that agreement which locked them up was allowed to collapse /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we find ourselves now with the North Koreans accumulating plutonium a bomb 's worth a year /.|||O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O
And freed up that plutonium that was um controlled for that period of time /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they say they 've used it to make bombs /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'd have to estimate about five more /.|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
And with each passing day I would argue to you more important than that missile that Ash would take out on the gantry if it turns up again with each passing day we 're going to find ourselves more and more closer than we were before to the day where that material could be transferred or sold to Al - Queda Presenting a threat far greater than the threat that is posed to us by nuclear weapons aboard ballistic missiles /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We can deter a country with ballistic missiles /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We know the return address /.|||O O O O O O
We do /.|||O O O
But with a terrorist unconventional delivery your national missile defense will not be very good against United Airlines or American Airlines Or a bus or a truck /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O
And deterrents does n't work terribly well when an enemy values your death more than his life /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So no defense no deterrents /.|||O O O O O O
we need to lock up the nuclear program /.|||O O O O O O O O O
You would not care about the ballistic missile program if they did not have the nuclear weapons program /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you can have all the agreements you want /.|||O O O O O O O O O O
if they 're going to cheat what good are they /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Madeline Albright essentially had it correct in my view /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
You make a deal /.|||O O O O O
Nobody did that deal in ninety four thinking we were trusting North Koreans /.|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O
We had some transparency a measure of it /.|||O O O O O O O O O
and you verify /.|||O O O O
We caught them cheating /.|||O O O O O
You might make another deal /.|||O O O O O O
I think you should /.|||O O O O O
You ask the question you make another deal are you better off with the deal /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
or are you better off without it /?|||O O O O O O O O
If the answer to the former is yes you do the deal /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You do n't +ask I think the simple question have they fooled us before /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then do n't let them fool us again /.|||O O O O O O O O O
I do n't believe that 's the way you proceed in international affairs /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It asks a very tough question about the national security /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
should we do this /?|||O O O O O
Is it better for us /?|||O O O O O O
Ask for more transparency /.|||O O O O O
Insist on it /.|||O O O O
Be tough in the negotiations Not in the formality of whether it 's six parties or it 's bilateral /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
Let me show you all two presidents Bill Clinton back in nineteen ninety three George Bush ten years later talking to the North Koreans in effect /.|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-PERSON I-PERSON B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O
And I 'm asking you to put your mind in place of a North Korean watching this /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O
President Clinton President Bush /.|||O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O
North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb /.|||B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
We had to be very firm about it /.|||O O O O O O O O O
We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea /.|||O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
Ash Carter both presidents making very firm resolved statements /.|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O
if you 're in North Korean watching that knowing that you now have the potential of building eight nuclear bombs what are you thinking /?|||O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Well I 'm concerned that they 're thinking that we 're giving a new meaning to the word intolerable Because they keep doing things that we say are intolerable and then we tolerate them /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's why I think at some point you have to draw the line with the North Koreans /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O
I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it 's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
So we were better off with the agreement than without it /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is possible to reach agreement with the North Koreans But not when they see the kind of footage that you uh showed Which is uh uh uh Americans drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back from that line And drawing a line in the sand and then stepping back /.|||O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think our diplomacy has to have carrots in it but it has to stand somewhere /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and as I suggested earlier I think the missile tests are a good place to take a stand /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Governor Richardson draw a line in the stand and step back /.|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
the North Koreans watch that /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O
they observe that /.|||O O O O
they know what their own has been /.|||O O O O O O O O
How do you have any strength in negotiating with people like that /?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The North Koreans in my dealings with them they care more about form than they do substance /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In your earlier segment you showed president Bush calling him a tyrant /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
But then later he called him Mister Kim Jong - Il /.|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
I was in North Korea when that happened /.|||O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O
The North Koreans were delighted because they felt they 'd been treated with respect /.|||B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O
They care deeply about protocol /.|||O O O O O O
And this is another reason why I think for a relatively cheap price a face to face negotiation at the level of Chris Hill who again is very competent I believe would set the stage for a final agreement at the six party talks Which is essential Which is basically a good agreement /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked /.|||O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they get food fuel energy assistance /.|||O O O O O O O
Security assurances we will not topple their regime /.|||O O O O O O O O O
That 's right /.|||O O O O
yeah that 's right /.|||O O O O O
that 's in that September agreement that Chris Hill negotiated /.|||O O O O B-DATE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O
My point is if it 's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong - Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we 've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ambassador Galluci based on your experience do you believe the North Koreans would give up their nuclear program give up their nuclear bombs which they believe in their mind is an insurance policy against an American invasion for economic assistance light water reactors /?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
At the end of the day I do n't know /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um but that leaves me to conclude since I really do n't know that it 's a good idea to find out /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program /.|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O
We did that /.|||O O O O
and for a period of years we were in a position to monitor that closely /.|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
and they did give it up /.|||O O O O O O O
Indeed you can make an argument that while the centrifuge program with the Pakistanis is clearly cheating was n't yet a genuine nuclear weapons program had n't produced anything and probably still has n't produced anything /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other , they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons /.|||O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only way to find out whether they 'll ultimately give up those weapons is to do a deal /.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Children are left at home in the rural areas , after parents leave to work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These are called left - behind children .|||O O O O O O O O
The parents are also forced to work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
In fact , they have no alternatives but to make such a decision .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are 120 million farmers who work in the city all year round in China , thus creating nearly 20 million left - behind children .|||O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O
I want to tell them that I miss them a lot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Day after day and year after year , they long for love in loneliness and wait for family affection in defect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that it is especially important to have emotional exchanges with the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Visit the children more often whenever possible .|||O O O O O O O O
-LSB- -RSB-|||O O
In September 2005 , a study report titled " Concern for Left - behind Children " had drawn wide public attention .|||O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O
While the situation of peasant workers in the city has repeatedly put society into question , the phenomenon of left - behind children in rural areas has gradually entered the view of the public .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ye Jingzhong is the assistant dean of the College of Humanities and Development at China Agricultural University , and team leader of the Left - behind Children Task Force .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
In the last two years , he has led the task force to conduct many field interviews and investigations on left - behind children in numerous rural areas in central and western China , including Shaanxi , Ningxia , Hebei , and Beijing .|||O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O O B-GPE O
Why did you pick the central and western parts of China , and not the south , to conduct this study ?|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O
First of all , for people who work in the city from the central and western regions um , uh , according to their educational level , they generally engage in strenuous manual labor when they leave for the city to work .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are not in a position to bring their children to the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When we conducted this research study , our focus was to analyze the impact on children when their parents , work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, its main impact is the lack of love because of the absence of their parents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , we believe that whether it 's in southern or northern part , no matter which part of the country the research is conducted in , the results should be consistent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
According to your estimation , how many left - behind children are there in China now ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O
This group should be the biggest in number .|||O O O O O O O O O
Um , the most conservative statistics for the group of people who leave the country to work in the city in our country is 100 million .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Nowadays , um , , um , many places , um , cite a figure of 120 million .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Many people quote a figure of 150 million .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Let 's think about it this way .|||O O O O O O O O
If we actually use 120 million as the statistic for the group who leave the country to work in the city , , at least half of them are um , married before they work in the city .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , families of these married people will usually have children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , they will usually have more than one child in rural areas .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O
So you can imagine .|||O O O O O
I believe the left - behind children group is definitely more than 10 or 20 million .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
It , uh , , in my opinion , should be around 50 million .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
Of course , we have not conducted exact statistical calculations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe the number of this group should be particularly large .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
According to the study by the task force , at present , the four main types of custody for left - behind children include single - parent custody , skip - generation custody , relative custody , and same - generation custody . Among which , single - parent custody had the highest number , accounting for 79.2 percent of the people surveyed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O
The next one was skip - generation custody , accounting for 16.9 percent . While those who lived with relatives or were entrusted to the care of someone else made up 4.1 percent and .9 percent of the total number of left - behind children , respectively .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O
According to your study , what do these left - behind children generally do with their daily life if their parents or parent work in the city ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Different types of custody have different impacts on their life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
No doubt , , single - parent custody definitely creates less impact compared to the other types .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The impact of single - parent custody is smaller because at least the mother is at home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no major problem in the children 's material life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , there are many impacts in other aspects , for instance , peer socialization .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The one that creates a huge impact is definitely skip - generation custody .|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Skip - generation custody means the grandparents look after the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is also relative or neighbor custody that asks neighbors or relatives to look after the children , and there is a type called self - custody .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These three types create the biggest and the most impact .|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
If we want to discuss this in more detail , let 's say , the skip - generation custody .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
First , in skip - generation custody , their material life will no doubt be a lot less taken care of when compared to the usual both parents or one parent at home situation .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is indisputable .|||O O O O
This type of family is not as good as the others .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had an example of a child in Shaanxi province .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
Um , there was a family !|||O O O O O O O
This family had an older brother and a younger sister .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Both parents wanted to go to the city to work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The father went first , and later the mother wanted to go , too .|||O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
What happened to these two children ?|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
The grandparents were unwilling to take care of them because in rural areas , grandparents also have to work in the field !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result , , this mother sent , these brother and sister , to martial arts school to study .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After they went to the martial arts school for a while , um , their mother was , um , a little worried , so she went to visit them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She went to visit them .|||O O O O O O
When she saw them , , the girl cried to her and said , " I really do n't want to stay here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I want to go home . "|||O O O O O O O
Later , the mother was moved and brought , this girl home and had the grandparents look after her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , she still , ai , left him at the martial arts school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , um , after the girl returned , the mother continued to work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When she came back one time in between work , she found that the girl 's body was dotted with red marks and red swellings .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She then discovered ah , um , the grandparents had not washed her clothes for a very long time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The situation you mentioned , is it common or is it a rather extreme example , because generally , people will think that grandparents will particularly love and care about their grandchildren ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The situation that I just mentioned regarding skip - generation custody is no doubt common .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why is it so ?|||O O O O O
You said that grandparents certainly have special love for the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is true .|||O O O O
It is true that they will go out of their way to pamper the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , for the elderly , with the difference in age and time , , their , ways of taking care and loving the children are different .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are influenced by their own habits .|||O O O O O O O O
For instance , there was a child who was sick .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , the grandparents asked him to take , a small pill that was made in Shaanxi .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
They did not even know what it was made of .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It was a local method .|||O O O O O O
Um , after all , they are different from , um , young people in this respect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Instead of sending the child to the hospital as quickly as possible , they are influenced by , some habits in this aspect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, they raised this point themselves .|||O O O O O O O
Another important point they mentioned was that they had to take care of the entire family .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Her father and mother are not home , so the entire family falls onto our shoulders , especially when we still have to be responsible for the farm work on the farmland .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , all I can do is to feed her and make sure that she is not cold . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They also had to face such a reality , one that they could not resolve .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After all , a family that had so many people in the beginning , , the parents of the children were a very important um , workforce .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now it was down to the two grandparents .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
No doubt , they could not help .|||O O O O O O O O
In the study of left - behind children , many staff found out by surprise that the biological cycle of the farmers who work in the city , and the inculcation and upbringing cycle of their children , have formed two parallel lines that will never meet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Farmers who work in the city are generally a young workforce in their prime , while this is the period in which their children attend primary or junior high school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Originally , they work in the city out of the hope that their children can receive a better education .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , adolescent children need the loving care and guidance of their parents even more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During this period , the absence of both or even one parent will create obstacles to the character development of the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This pair of unavoidable contradictions has made the problem of left - behind children in rural areas become more obvious .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You have seen many kinds of left - behind children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Was there a particular case or a particular child who had left an especially deep impression on you that you still remember now ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, um , there was a child in Ningxia whose name was Yao Zhengang .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
This child , um , did not do exceptionally well in school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What impressed me the most about him was that he really missed his parents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He felt particularly lonely and especially wanted his father to come back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said that he was sick one time .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
His father worked in Guyuan , about 40 to 50 kilometers away from home .|||O O O O B-GPE O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O
After his father learned that he was very sick , he ran back to the village right away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After he arrived at the village , he did not say anything , but to put him on his back and carry him to the town to see a doctor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He just carried him like that without saying a word .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
When the doctor in the town took a look and told him that they were unable to cure the sickness , he carried the child to the county .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Yao Zhengang told us what happened , he said , " My father had never bought me so many tasty foods before .|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On that day , he bought me a lot of tasty food while we were in the county , but he did not eat any himself . "|||O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought about this at that time .|||O O O O O O O O
After I heard this incident , I particularly understood what was in the mind of Yao Zhengang 's father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O
He might have felt especially guilty toward his child .|||O O O O O O O O O O
What he felt was that " I go out to work and leave my child home . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said that his child had also said , " When he was at home , he always encouraged me . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He would say , " No problem . You work hard and get a better grade next time , " when I had low grades .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If he could receive many , such encouragements , he would not have um , um , disliked school sometimes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He does not want to go to school now .|||O O O O O O O O O O
However , in his example , I could imagine what went through his father 's mind at that time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think that he felt very guilty toward his child .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , I can feel that um , um , parents who work in the city also have no alternative .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are forced into making such decisions .|||O O O O O O O O
Um , there was also this child .|||O O O O O O O O
There was a child , a girl in Xixiang county , Shaanxi province .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O B-GPE I-GPE O
Um , when I asked , " What do you think are the changes that your parents working in the city have caused you ? " She did not answer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She went home to get a small box .|||O O O O O O O O O
There was a small finger inside the box .|||O O O O O O O O O
This was a very terrifying incident .|||O O O O O O O
What was the small finger all about ?|||O O O O O O O O
What happened was that when her um , parents left to work in the city , her grandparents looked after her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They had a cellar at home and inside was a hay cutter for cutting hay .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When she went downstairs to play by herself , an accident happened .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her grandparents said , " We ca n't help .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We ca n't keep an eye on her all the time . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, before they went to work in the city , they could watch her and forbade her to go down to the cellar .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He had told her not to do that before .|||O O O O O O O O O O
However , I said that sometimes it is very difficult to ask children to have self control .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That was why she turned this way .|||O O O O O O O O

This is Ruangang village , Bocang town , Yi county , Hebei province .|||O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O
Among the 303 households in the village , one - third of the families have people who work in the city .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
More than half of the children in the village are left - behind children .|||B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of the children 's parents are in the southern part of the country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many people want to save some travel expenses and earn some more money , so it is very common for them not to return home for a year or two .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Life is so vast .|||O O O O O
Life is an ocean wherever life exists .|||O O O O O O O O
It has been six years since 14 - year - old Jiang Beiwen was sent by his parents to live with his maternal grandfather in Ruangang village .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
His parents rely on selling rice in Guangzhou to support their child 's education .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
They live a very hard life .|||O O O O O O O
Little Beiwen has not seen them once in the past six years .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Oh , I see so many children here who can turn for comfort in their parents ' arms !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ah , I envy them .|||O O O O O O
So , I also , want to be able to turn to comfort in my parents ' arms .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was at school the time I missed my mother the most .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh huh .|||O O O
We had a market !|||O O O O O
Oh , every day , there were parents who bought things for their oh , sons and daughters .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I also wish that my parents could buy me things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I envied them very much .|||O O O O O O
That was when I missed my mother the most .|||O O O O O O O O O O
This is Jiang Beiwen 's favorite photo .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O
It was taken with his father six years ago , before he sent him to live with his maternal grandfather .|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was only eight years old at that time .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
The only connection that little Beiwen has with his parents now is to talk on the phone with them once a week .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In his opinion , affection among family members is something unreachable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
How often can your mother call you ?|||O O O O O O O O
Uh , once a week !|||O O O O O O
What do you talk about ?|||O O O O O O
I will talk about my studies and life .|||O O O O O O O O O
My schoolwork was not quite good when I first came !|||O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O
My mother scolded me in the beginning when my schoolwork was poor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She said that I was losing honor for not doing well at school !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I cried and after that , my mother cried , too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since they move from place to place in the city to work all year round , parents of left - behind children have little communication with their children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While for temporary custodians , they are only limited to providing superficial care , such as making sure the children have food and stay warm , but can not fulfill the responsibility of educating the children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The survey found that 36.7 percent of the children had never been to their parents ' workplace .|||O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O
8.2 percent of the parents almost never contacted their children .|||B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O
21.4 percent of the parents contacted their children less than once a month .|||B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since their parents are absent , how can these children communicate and exchange with their parents ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our study found that um , um , the principal means of contact between the left - behind children and their parents was through the telephone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , contrary to our belief that they could talk on the phone for a long time when they called , approximately 50 percent of the left - behind children we surveyed talked on the phone with their parents for three minutes or so .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O
What could they talk about in three minutes ?|||O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
I think it is hard to say anything meaningful in three minutes .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
Of course , we also studied what these children talked to their parents about in these three - minute telephone conversations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O
What did the parents who worked in the city talk about with their children ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What touched us very deeply was that 70 percent of the content of the children 's conversations with their parents was to ask about their safety and not other things , such as how much they had earned .|||O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As for the content of the parents ' conversations with their children , first , it was school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O
Whether they were good and how their schoolwork was .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Second , it was whether they obeyed their custodians and what they ate and things like that .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Uh , as for safety matters , in fact , they could not have any emotional exchange .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We know that sometimes when we talk on the phone , even a pause is a need for emotional exchange .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the parents may not have realized this .|||O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , the child has stopped talking .|||O O O O O O O O O
He stops talking because he needs to pause to consider how to say what is in his mind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The parents may not have realized this point , so they hang up the phone immediately .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , for three minutes , why was it only for three minutes ?|||O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
In many cases , it was because they worried about the charge .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
, many left - behind children told us that they especially wanted to call their parents on the phone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , um , they considered that um , one thing , sometimes they did not have a telephone at home .|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was very difficult for children to borrow the phone from their neighbors .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Second , um , they considered that they needed money to make a phone call .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some children told me , " I secretly called my parents when my custodians were not home . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The children have a great need for this type of telephone exchange .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do the left - behind children understand why their parents work in the city ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , um , we conducted a survey on this question .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were very surprised to find that 40 percent of the left - behind children had no idea what jobs their parents held away from home .|||O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How could that be possible ?|||O O O O O O
How could that be possible ?|||O O O O O O
We interviewed some left - behind children , their custodians , and the people who work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why would n't the children know what they did ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
First , we can tell from the content of the three - minute telephone conversations we mentioned earlier that children are particularly concerned about the safety of the parents who work in the city .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , a lot of the work that the parents engaged in is dangerous work , including coalmines , construction , and some others , many of them are dangerous jobs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , I believe the parents of these left - behind children also choose not to take the initiative and tell them the nature of their job .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why do they do that ?|||O O O O O O
It is because they are afraid that their children will worry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Second , , parents , especially fathers , who work in the city have a particularly lofty image in the children 's mind .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe they do not want their children to know about the nature of their job or tell them what they do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They , do not want to destroy the lofty image of themselves in the child 's mind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At noon , the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather went to work in the field and did not come home .|||O B-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jiang Beiwen has to make lunch for himself .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O
This happens to him very often .|||O O O O O O O
He could look after himself since he was nine .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
What work are you going to do today , other than cooking ?|||O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O
Uh , I will do the dishes after I finish eating .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
If it is Sunday when I am free , I will , also do some farm work .|||O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What kind of work ?|||O O O O O
Uh , I will hoe the field , uh , when we are in a hurry to till the land for growing crops , I will help do some work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you still remember your mother 's cooking ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Uh huh , I do .|||O O O O O O
It was especially tasty .|||O O O O O
Now , the most I want to know is , my parents ' health .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why do you want to know about that ?|||O O O O O O O O O
It is because I care about my parents very much .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I think about their work because I know that they work in the city because of me , so I care about them a lot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will be worn out from working in the city , working in the city to make money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe it is also because of me , so I care about their health a lot .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of you , why is it because of you ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Because if they did n't have me , I think they uh , would be a lot more , relaxed when they worked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then , are these children willing to live with their parents ? Or go to the city with them ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In regard to this , first , , children all want their parents to come back to live with them .|||O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , 51 percent of the children we surveyed were unwilling to go to the city with their parents , go to the city , to live in the city .|||O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , they all wanted their parents to come back , but half of the children did not want to go to the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also asked them why they did not want to go to the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was also very surprising to us .|||O O O O O O O O
They said that the city is another world and they were especially worried .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were afraid that once they go to the city , they will not be able to assimilate into the schools and things like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Second , they realized that it is already a very difficult task for their parents to work in the city .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their parents have to send money home , among other things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
If they go live with them , they will add more burdens to their parents .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If we are in the city every day , live in the city every day , we may know that oh , city life is like this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As for children from rural areas and people from rural areas who work in the city , they are not familiar with this world and they have a type of fear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As for parents , are they more willing to bring their children with them or leave them at home ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe when parents make this decision , their main consideration is not willing or unwilling .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All parents , I can say the majority of the parents , definitely want to live with their children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , with the reality that they have to face , I believe that they can not solve this problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , we know what the reality is .|||O O O O O O O O O O
First , their families are rather poor to begin with .|||B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
Only the lower - middle class will leave the rural areas and work in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have to make money to support the family .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They will need a huge sum of money in order to bring their children to the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nonetheless , I believe there are also many other reasons .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They also have to consider whether their children can go to school in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have to find a place to live .|||O O O O O O O O O
All these are problems that they need to resolve .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The problems they face are too many .|||O O O O O O O O
If the children go to the city , the expenses will be very high .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since circumstances do not permit , they can not bring their children with them , according to their will or their psychological need .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many parents are unable to bring their children with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
What would you tell your parents if you could see them now ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I want to tell them that I miss them very much .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Judging from the surface , is there any obvious difference between the character of these left - behind children and non-left - behind children ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is hard to tell from the surface .|||O O O O O O O O O
Why is it so ?|||O O O O O
For these children , it depends on how long their parents have been working in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For example , some have just gone for a year , while others have gone for 10 years already .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
In this case , um , generally speaking , uh , we did not conduct any psychological testing or comparison in this psychological aspect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , many schools and custodians reported that many left - behind children had become very withdrawn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They had very strange um , um , temperaments .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They did not like to speak .|||O O O O O O O
There was , a child who was in the first year of junior high school .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
Um , um , he told us himself that he particularly , um , um , misses his father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was very good at school .|||O O O O O O O
However , one time we visited him , his um , family told us that he was second in his class in his examination .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O
After that , he became extremely , extremely , annoyed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , um , um , his language and other things became very strange .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , um , we also asked his um , um , grandparents who had custody of him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said that when his father was home , he would always encourage him and um , exchange with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , of course , it was not necessarily because his parents worked in the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , for some left - behind children , their parents working in the city has caused some psychological abnormalities and unusual development .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This situation indeed exists .|||O O O O O
After all , these are families whose love is inadequate and incomplete .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe love is especially important .|||O O O O O O O
Children need love from the time they are small .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We have to understand our Chinese saying , " The child is father to the man . "|||O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O
What it says is that the character that children form at a very young age will affect their entire life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only children who are loved and who realize the importance of love since they are young will be able to love other people in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the case .|||O O O O O
Therefore , for this type , um , um , um , this group of left - behind children , psychologically , they do not have family love .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um , , if the parents work in the city , these children perhaps will not receive timely attention when they encounter many difficulties at home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps the neighbors around are all facing different realities and can not offer them timely love .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Under this situation , I believe , I am not sure , um , I am unwilling to imagine what mentality and character these children will develop when they grow up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Will they believe there is love in society or not ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Will they think that love is important in society or not , because they have never experienced it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have never completely experienced it .|||O O O O O O O
Thus , if such a large group in society does not realize that love should be , um , given or received in society , I think this is , something that I do not want to imagine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the guarantee in food , clothing , and school that left - behind children get because their parents work in the city to make money , they do not have the psychological and physiological satisfaction that they require .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
According to the survey , more than half of the left - behind children were dissatisfied with their current life .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
58 percent of the left - behind children believed that they were unhappy .|||B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are the parents worried about leaving their children at home by themselves ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do they understand the living conditions of their children at home ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They thought that this was a reality that they could not um , um , face .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were condemned to this reality .|||O O O O O O O
No doubt , I think some , um , parents have not had such profound consideration .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why do n't they ?|||O O O O O
I believe people are all the same .|||O O O O O O O O
If they face such an urgent need for a livelihood , their first consideration will be the need for a livelihood .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O
They can not consider the deeper issue of children 's safety and psychology when their livelihood has not been solved , satisfied , and guaranteed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For example , there were two sisters who lived in a cave dwelling in Shaanxi province .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O

Once there was a flood .|||O O O O O O
, these sisters stayed in the cave dwelling to look after the home !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This happened in the rural area .|||O O O O O O O
These two children were looking after the home .|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Their uncle saved them when the flood was almost past their bellies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their father called later to see if they were fine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The family told him that they were fine .|||O O O O O O O O O
He did not come back after that .|||O O O O O O O O
He did not come back to check if everything was fine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe the reason he did not return was that he would ponder whether he should return or not .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I was n't up the sharp end .|||O O O O O O O O
I was n't taking risks .|||O O O O O O
I was n't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside Bagdad airport but I had long thought and I was in Iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , Saddam Hussein made the only self criticism .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O

Maybe before the weapon and then later he said , Oh , I should have got the nuclear weapon before I invaded .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was right about that , but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen - years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we 're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O

They ask again , Are you sure they mean that ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They ca n't believe the luck .|||O O O O O O O
They use the gunships to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of southern Iraq and trying to do that to the Kurds , as well , so it was a knife edge .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O

Nice to be here , Lou .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O
Let 's start with that surprise , the malfeasance that is crossing your desk .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you suggesting corporate America has not learned its lesson yet ?|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Well , no .|||O O O O
I think that quote is a little out of context there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are 15,000 companies in the United States , and I think the great bulk of them are very honestly managed and so forth .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a number of people have had egregious fraud and so forth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's been a general loosening of morals across the board .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
What I was referring to in that quote you had was the number of cases we see day in and day out at the lowest levels , scams and so forth , where considerable amounts of money are being made and lost by relatively small investors .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is the investor today in your judgment secure ?|||O O O B-DATE O O O O O
Well , I think that the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think a number of the reforms that have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act and a number of things that we have done at the SEC are basically making everybody take a new look at how they 're performing their duty as a director , how they 're performing their duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in Wall Street .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-LAW I-LAW I-LAW I-LAW I-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
I think the reforms that came as a part of the large settlement are going to change the way research and investment banking are done to the betterment of the individual investor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And some people are surprised and I might even add pleased in this city that your SEC has been quick to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that your SEC did n't think and that you did n't think expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of the SEC .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
It was n't a polite phone call quietly made , either from your enforcement division or from your office , it was rather public .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is that the way you 're going to operate ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Well , Lou , we 're deadly serious about bringing reform into the marketplace .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
We 're deadly serious about some of the actions we 've taken , and when we see people who do n't appear to be taking it too seriously , we 're going to get to them right away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I think perhaps no one more surprised than some of the people running those firms on Wall Street .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O
You have also expressed concern about excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is there really anything that can be done about this problem ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think so , Lou .|||O O O O B-PERSON O
I think the real next step here is for compensation committees to spend a little more time than they do on what they 're really compensating for .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think there are a number of other measures that indicate how well somebody 's doing running a company , and I think corporation boards need to spend more time on that dimension .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

While U.S. forces still have n't found any weapons of mass destruction , the new CIA Pentagon report says officials are now confident the mysterious trucks filled with high - tech equipment found in Iraq are indeed mobile biological weapons production facilities , just as Secretary of State Powell predicted and presented the United Nations before the war .|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG B-PERSON O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O

It was very stern , very direct and it left no question , I think , in the minds of anybody that this court unanimously believes that certification should include the manual recount , and that is a clear victory for Vice President Al Gore .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O

The amended certifications must be accepted by November 26 .|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
The reason they are picking that particular day is it allows , Brian , enough time for the aggrieved party , the losing party to file within 10 days a contest of the certification and that still allows enough time for the contest to be litigated through the courts primarily the circuit court and back to the Supreme Court if necessary and still meet the December 12 deadline for the Electoral College vote here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O

He said exactly what the Indians wanted to hear , which is that the dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan should be solved bilaterally and that there should be no outside interference , as he put it in this question .|||O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now this is something the Indians have been saying all along .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , Pakistan wants international attention focussed on Kashmir , and Mr. Putin also said that he supports India 's tough approach to the external violence in Kashmir as he described it .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O
This is another thing that the Indians were glad to hear him say , and he also said that both India and Russia suffer from the same sort of terrorism , as he put it , referring of course to the separatist militancies in Chechnya and Russia and in Jammu and Kashmir .|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O B-GPE O B-GPE O

What sort of hold does Russia have on India and Pakistan ?|||O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O B-GPE O
Russia has very little influence with Pakistan , but of course Russia supplies India with 70 % of its military hardware and that was of course the second pillar here of Mr. Putin 's visit , which was to finalize some very substantial arms deals .|||B-GPE O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O

That 's an interesting question because Vladimir Putin on Wednesday addressed the Indian Parliament just as Bill Clinton had done six months ago , and I think it 's safe to say that Mr. Putin actually probably accomplished more than Mr. Clinton did in the hard concrete terms of arms sales and that sort of thing , but it was Mr. Clinton that stole the Indian lawmakers ' hearts .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-DATE O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O B-NORP O O O O

There are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , for instance showing whether a sample contains the deadly Entero 71 virus , or Coxsackie A16 , which is easily confused with Entero 71 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , the chip and its accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required for testing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Meanwhile on microarray chips , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

To test a blood sample using a microarray chip , the sample must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before being put onto the chip where the " hybridization " reaction takes place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the results are analyzed using a detection system .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence these chips are only suitable for use in the laboratory .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done on the chip itself , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto the chip to obtain a result .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

However , due to Taiwan 's early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry , the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , says Lee , " Taiwan should have opportunities to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "|||O O O B-PERSON O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The potential and importance of biochips is plain to see , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties to overcome .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment is the many thousands of patents which have been taken out in the field , which limit the avenues available to each player .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it 's impossible to create a product which from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says Johnsee Lee .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
In his view , this problem may be resolved in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At present , the BMEC has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .|||O O O O B-ORG O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pushing the envelope|||O O O
Although at their present stage of development , biochips are already a great help to researchers , they are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But one day they will play an important role in all our lives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says Johnsee Lee .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
He says that only if research results are commercialized does research produce an economic payback .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Equally , to have a really broad market biochips need to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lee points out that before biochips will be worth commercializing , sample preparation needs to be made convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , the chips ' speed and accuracy must be high , and their cost must be low .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He predicts that in one to two years , biochips will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it should be possible to develop them into general screening tools which will be as easy to use as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable everyone to learn their current state of health and know what diseases they may develop in the future .|||B-ORG O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology , the medical problems so discovered may not be treatable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mankind is always challenging his limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases , the next challenge will have only just begun .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

On November 24 the New Party , which had already pulled out of the Advisory Group , published an article in the press signed by leading members such as Yu Mu - ming and Chen Kui - miao , in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the " one China " deadlock .|||O B-DATE I-DATE B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL B-GPE O O O

For example , the " bag - wrap " method was originally a way of protecting budding fruit from birds , but once it was introduced to Linpien , in around 1994 , farmers found it enabled them to grow more lustrous , shiny - looking wax apples , with less pesticide on the skin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The method soon caught on throughout the district .|||O O O O O O O O O
Another popular technique involves covering the trees with black mosquito nets to improve yields .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the trees , causing nutrients from the leaves and branches to be diverted into producing fruit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The net - covered trees blossom earlier and produce more fruit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result of this technique , black pearl wax apples are now available throughout most of the year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O

Tips for Getting through Middle Age|||O O O O O O

Middle age and the changes it brings are like a revolving door .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many people peacefully go through it , growing wiser and losing their rough edges .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A minority do n't know whether to advance or retreat and get caught in it like a trap .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a result , the crises experienced by a minority of middle - aged people can involve a lot of other people , so their impact can not be overlooked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Middle age , those years between 40 and 60 , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that 's easiest to overlook .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of as the time when power , ability , wealth , and physical strength are all at or near their peak , so that one has no excuse for feeling melancholy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even if there are problems , it is commonly thought that one should be able to resolve them by oneself , notes Chiu Chia - li , director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center , who has worked on many middle - aged cases .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O
Social bias makes many of the middle aged afraid to discuss their problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is particularly the case for men , who generally find it difficult to talk about their feelings .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But by keeping everything inside , they may cause irreparable harm to their health .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here are a few suggestions :|||O O O O O O
1. Live well at every stage of life|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Li Liang - che , a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O
He points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Smoothly passing through any period of life helps make getting through the next period easier .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who have had difficulties earlier in life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways to get out of trouble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is it too late to start talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chang Der - chung , an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Middle - aged problems are rather predictable , and they 're not hard to avoid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then no matter how busy you are , you 've got to set aside some time to be with your spouse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you worried about losing your job ?|||O O O O O O O O
Then start developing a second skill and get into the habit of saving and managing your money .|||O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you worried about how to care for your parents when they get old and sick ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then spend more time with them , and encourage them to get more exercise and take care of themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are so many things to be concerned about during middle age that you had better get an early start .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Otherwise , you 'll end up being overwhelmed .|||O O O O O O O O O
2. Start over|||B-CARDINAL O O
In China it used to be said that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity . "|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for solving today 's problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To assume a posture of superiority based on one 's seniority will make one despised .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hence , it is necessary to cast aside one 's old self and start over .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chiu notes that many middle - aged who have worked diligently for years to attain management positions look down on the younger generation for being reckless and disorganized , but they do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready to explode from underneath these flaws .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stuck in the past and full of bitterness , they may end up getting discarded onto the scrap heap of history .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With each new era , role models change .|||O O O O O O O O O
Until the new role models have been established , it is important to maintain flexibility .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , today 's middle - aged Chinese women are the first to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .|||O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They set high expectations for themselves , but their disappointments are likewise large .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many women are torn between conflicting desires : to be good homemakers like their mothers and to have successful careers like their fathers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their candles are burning at both ends , because they are trying to live up to two old role models rather than establishing a new one for themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then there are men who insist upon being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until they retire .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And there are women who are determined to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
Ignoring the changing times , they place tremendous pressure on themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
3. Turn the focus from outside to inside|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
Life is a process that moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says Alice Lu , director of the International Family Life Education Center , getting to the heart of the matter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O
Lu explains that as children people yearn for the affection of their parents ; as adolescents they want the affirmation of their peers ; and as adults , they set their sights on educational qualifications , finding a good job , making money , marrying a good spouse and so forth .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone puts the emphasis on outward manifestations of success , and this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement continues up to middle age .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" By middle age , people have gotten from the outside world just about all they can , " says Lu .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
" What they have n't attained yet they probably wo n't attain ever , so it 's not worth getting all worked up about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the time of life when the doubts set in . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many middle - aged people begin to ask themselves , " Is this really what I want ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What has been the point of all my hard striving ? "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the doubts come , some people continue trying to find answers from outside , thinking that everything would be fine if they could just change jobs or wives !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But then they rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved in an affair only to find that they 've just made things worse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" In middle age you start to listen to what 's going on inside , " says Lu .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
" It 's the time of life when you start to hone your skills at conversing with your soul . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
People ask themselves : Am I truly happy ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Do I like the person I see in the mirror ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Why ?|||O O
What dreams can I pursue ?|||O O O O O O
At this point , there is no longer any need to try to measure oneself against outside standards .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Instead it 's more important to accept oneself and attempt to find an inner balance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" One need not compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes Chiu .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Everyone 's circumstances and personalities are different , and they place different expectations on themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's not a matter of being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need to follow the currents of fashion .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone is unique .|||O O O O
Morris Chang was in his fifties when he became an entrepreneur and founded Taiwan Semiconductor .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
Many others at the same time in life have opted to take early retirement and find a guru in India , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else they want to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the modern age when people value different things , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4. Realistically strive for one 's dreams|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O
When focusing inward , many dreams that have long been discarded will end up floating to the surface .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At such times , one should remember to ask oneself three questions :|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
" What do I want ? " " What can I do ? " And " What must I do and have ? "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chang Der - chung reminds people to think clearly about their needs , and then think about the costs .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Will meeting these personal needs necessarily come into conflict with meeting one 's responsibilities ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is there some way that the two can be accomplished simultaneously ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When facing problems at work in Taiwan , many people decide to change careers or even to pursue their fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-LOC I-LOC O
Pursuing some dream of really making it big , many men use up their savings , leaving their wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way to guarantee a venture will be successful , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" It is indeed the case that when one is young , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says Chang by way of analogy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
" Once you get into middle age , you 've got to make every arrow count . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chang explains that everyone has dreams , and that continually working toward those dreams is an excellent method of relieving stress at any age .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Middle - aged people have heavy burdens , and sometimes they may feel as if they are suffocating under them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" But accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you make an effort to do what you can , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chang cites this example : Say you hate being tied up by your work , and would like to go back to school .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why do n't you try a weekend class ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Maybe that would help to alleviate your anxiety .|||O O O O O O O O O
Or if you are a housewife , taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could work as a volunteer in a community organization .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you can help to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by making a habit of regularly exercising .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What 's more , do n't worry too much about time being short .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Remember that most modern people live long lives that can be divided up into many stages .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society , decide which of your problems are the most urgent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't try to accomplish all of your dreams at once .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for opportunities to present themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5. Change your perspective|||B-CARDINAL O O O
In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I am thankful for the bad times , for they have given me more insight into life and a better opportunity to understand myself , " says Lin Hung - kuei , an I - kuan Tao devotee , who has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O
Taking care of your parents , losing your job , illness and even being cheated out of money can be embraced as opportunities to experience life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are lessons that the middle - aged learn from to become more proficient at the art of living .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" By changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points out Chiu Chia - li .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
It is very important to adjust your frame of mind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As for losing your job in middle age , some people make NT$ 100,000 and it 's not enough .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O
Other's find that NT$ 20,000 is more than enough to support the family .|||O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O
The problem is that by insisting on making NT$ 100,000 a month , you may pass by a suitable job that pays NT$ 20,000 .|||O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O
Chang also notes that when people come to forks in the road when they reach middle age , they may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but they 've got to encourage themselves to keep pressing ahead .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the very least , you 've got to work hard at establishing a sense of direction .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Li Liang - che starts feeling sorry for himself , he uses the age - old method of considering those who are even worse off .|||O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Those people who are always complaining about their lot in life should take a walk around a cancer ward , " Li says .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
Then they 'll realize how lucky they are . "|||O O O O O O O O O O
Chiu Chia - li , on the other hand , encourages the middle - aged not to close themselves off .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They must get out and make friends , so as to get things off their chests and find support from each other .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This makes it easier to get through the bad times .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , there is something that may seem a little cliched but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it 's important to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of the middle - aged , " says Chang .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Much like rebellious adolescents , they may merely need to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which is the most troublesome right now ?|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O

Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O

Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically .|||O B-PERSON O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa .|||O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O
Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-LOC I-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . ''|||O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot ?|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP I-NORP O O O O O O O O O
It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur .|||O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O B-ORG O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is double - edged , aiming inward as well as outward .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
Why constructive ?|||O O O
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well - intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer .

The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue - collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O
But these are not the differences that make headlines .|||O O O O O O O O O O
In `` Chicken Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie -LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB- , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- Rita Karin -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- Brandon Maggart -RRB- .|||O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O B-NORP O O B-PERSON B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-NORP O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O

Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real - life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE B-ORG O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .|||O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .|||O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic - Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O B-NORP O O B-FAC O

Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LAW O O O O O O B-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .|||O O O O B-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .|||O O O O O O B-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good - faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O B-LAW O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Especially deserving to be pointed out is that , after the first monthly deficit in July last year , the rest of the year saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million US dollars in July to 722 million US dollars in December , reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-DATE O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-DATE O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of last year was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which is even higher than that of exports .|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Pharisees asked , `` Then why did Moses give a command allowing a man to divorce his wife by writing a certificate of divorce ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because you refused to accept God 's teaching .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But divorce was not allowed in the beginning .|||O O O O O O O O O
I tell you that whoever divorces his wife , except for the problem of sexual sin , and marries another woman is guilty of adultery . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers said to Jesus , `` If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife , it is better not to marry . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` This statement is true for some , but not for everyone -- only for those who have been given this gift .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are different reasons why some men do n't marry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Some were born without the ability to produce children .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Others were made that way later in life .|||O O O O O O O O O
And others have given up marriage because of God 's kingdom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is for anyone who is able to accept it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so that he could lay his hands on them to bless them and pray for them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the followers saw this , they told the people to stop bringing their children to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus said , `` Let the little children come to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't stop them , because God 's kingdom belongs to people who are like these children . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After Jesus blessed the children , he left there .|||O O O O O O O O O O
A man came to Jesus and asked , `` Teacher , what good thing must I do to have eternal life ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` Why do you ask me about what is good ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only God is good .|||O O O O O
But if you want to have eternal life , obey the law 's commands . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man asked , `` Which ones ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` ' You must not murder anyone , you must not commit adultery , you must not steal , you must not tell lies about others , you must respect your father and mother , ' and ' love your neighbor the same as you love yourself . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The young man said , `` I have obeyed all these commands .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What else do I need ? ''|||O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` If you want to be perfect , then go and sell all that you own .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Give the money to the poor , and you will have riches in heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then come and follow me ! ''|||O O O O O O O
But when the young man heard Jesus tell him to give away his money , he was sad .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He did n't want to do this , because he was very rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he left .|||O O O O
Then Jesus said to his followers , `` The truth is , it will be very hard for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I tell you , it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God 's kingdom . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers were amazed to hear this .|||O O O O O O O O
They asked , `` Then who can be saved ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus looked at them and said , `` This is something that people can not do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But God can do anything . ''|||O O O O O O O
Peter said to him , `` We left everything we had and followed you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what will we have ? ''|||O O O O O O O
Jesus said to them , `` When the time of the new world comes , the Son of Man will sit on his great and glorious throne .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I can promise that you who followed me will sit on twelve thrones , and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone who has left houses , brothers , sisters , father , mother , children , or farms to follow me will get much more than they left .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they will have eternal life .|||O O O O O O O
Many people who are first now will be last in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And many who are last now will be first in the future .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said , `` Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom come with power before you die . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Six days later , Jesus took Peter , James , and John and went up on a high mountain .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were all alone there .|||O O O O O O
While these followers watched him , Jesus was changed .|||O O O O O O O O O O
His clothes became shining white -- whiter than anyone on earth could make them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then two men were there talking with Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O
They were Elijah and Moses .|||O O O O O O
Peter said to Jesus , `` Teacher , it is good that we are here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter did not know what to say , because he and the other two followers were so afraid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then a cloud came and covered them .|||O O O O O O O O
A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son , the one I love .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Obey him ! ''|||O O O O
The followers looked , but they saw only Jesus there alone with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As Jesus and the followers were walking back down the mountain , he gave them these instructions : `` Do n't tell anyone about what you saw on the mountain .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wait until after the Son of Man rises from death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then you can tell people what you saw . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
So the followers waited to say anything about what they saw .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they discussed among themselves what Jesus meant about rising from death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They asked him , `` Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` They are right to say that Elijah must come first .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Elijah makes all things the way they should be .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man will suffer much and that people will think he is worth nothing ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I tell you that Elijah has already come .|||O O O O O O O O O
And people did to him all the bad things they wanted to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Scriptures said this would happen to him . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus , Peter , James , and John went to the other followers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They saw many people around them .|||O O O O O O O
The teachers of the law were arguing with the followers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
When the people saw Jesus , they were very surprised and ran to welcome him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus asked , `` What are you arguing about with the teachers of the law ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A man answered , `` Teacher , I brought my son to you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is controlled by an evil spirit that keeps him from talking .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The spirit attacks him and throws him on the ground .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes very stiff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out , but they could not . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` You people today do n't believe !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
How long must I stay with you ?|||O O O O O O O O
How long must I be patient with you ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Bring the boy to me ! ''|||O O O O O O O
So the followers brought the boy to Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O
When the evil spirit saw Jesus , it attacked the boy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The boy fell down and rolled on the ground .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He was foaming at the mouth .|||O O O O O O O
Jesus asked the boy 's father , `` How long has this been happening to him ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The father answered , `` Since he was very young .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you can do anything , please have pity on us and help us . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to the father , `` Why did you say ' if you can ' ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All things are possible for the one who believes . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Immediately the father shouted , `` I do believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Help me to believe more ! ''|||O O O O O O O
Jesus saw that all the people were running there to see what was happening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he spoke to the evil spirit .|||O O O O O O O O
He said , `` You evil spirit that makes this boy deaf and stops him from talking -- I command you to come out of him and never enter him again ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The evil spirit screamed .|||O O O O O
It caused the boy to fall on the ground again , and then it came out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The boy looked as if he was dead .|||O O O O O O O O O
Many people said , `` He is dead ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus took hold of his hand and helped him stand up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus went into the house .|||O O O O O O O
His followers were alone with him there .|||O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Why were n't we able to force that evil spirit out ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` That kind of spirit can be forced out only with prayer . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus and his followers left there and went through Galilee .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus did not want the people to know where they were .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He wanted to teach his followers alone .|||O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` The Son of Man will be handed over to the control of other men , who will kill him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After three days , he will rise from death . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the followers did not understand what he meant , and they were afraid to ask him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum .|||O O O O O O O O
They went into a house , and Jesus said to them , `` I heard you arguing on the way here today .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What were you arguing about ? ''|||O O O O O O O
But the followers did not answer , because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Whoever wants to be the most important must make others more important than themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They must serve everyone else . ''|||O O O O O O O
Then Jesus took a small child and stood the child in front of the followers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He held the child in his arms and said , `` Whoever accepts children like these in my name is accepting me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then John said , `` Teacher , we saw a man using your name to force demons out of someone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is not one of us .|||O O O O O O O
So we told him to stop , because he does not belong to our group . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Do n't stop him .|||O O O O O O O O O
Whoever uses my name to do powerful things will not soon say bad things about me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever is not against us is with us .|||O O O O O O O O O
I can assure you that anyone who helps you by giving you a drink of water because you belong to the Christ will definitely get a reward .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` If one of these little children believes in me , and someone causes that child to sin , it will be very bad for that person .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It would be better for them to have a millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the sea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If your hand makes you sin , cut it off .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two hands and go to hell .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There the fire never stops .|||O O O O O O
If your foot makes you sin , cut it off .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is better for you to lose part of your body and have eternal life than to have two feet and be thrown into hell .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If your eye makes you sin , take it out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It is better for you to have only one eye and enter God 's kingdom than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The worms that eat the people in hell never die .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The fire there is never stopped .|||O O O O O O O
`` Everyone will be salted with fire .|||O O O O O O O O
`` Salt is good .|||O O O O O
But if it loses its salty taste , you ca n't make it good again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , do n't lose that good quality of salt you have .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And live in peace with each other . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Jesus called his twelve apostles together .|||O O O O O O O
He gave them power to heal sicknesses and power to force demons out of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He sent them to tell about God 's kingdom and to heal the sick .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to them , `` When you travel , do n't take a walking stick .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , do n't carry a bag , food , or money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Take for your trip only the clothes you are wearing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
When you go into a house , stay there until it is time to leave .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the people in the town will not welcome you , go outside the town and shake the dust off your feet as a warning to them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the apostles went out .|||O O O O O O
They traveled through all the towns .|||O O O O O O O
They told the Good News and healed people everywhere .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Herod the ruler heard about all these things that were happening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was confused because some people said , `` John the Baptizer has risen from death . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Others said , `` Elijah has come to us . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And some others said , `` One of the prophets from long ago has risen from death . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Herod said , `` I cut off John 's head .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So who is this man I hear these things about ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Herod continued trying to see Jesus .|||O O O O O O O
When the apostles came back , they told Jesus what they had done on their trip .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he took them away to a town called Bethsaida .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
There , he and his apostles could be alone together .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He welcomed them and talked with them about God 's kingdom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He healed the people who were sick .|||O O O O O O O O
Late in the afternoon , the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said , `` No one lives in this place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Send the people away .|||O O O O O
They need to find food and places to sleep in the farms and towns around here . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus said to the apostles , `` You give them something to eat . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` We have only five loaves of bread and two fish .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do you want us to go buy food for all these people ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are too many !|||O O O O O
-LRB- There were about 5000 men there . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to his followers , `` Tell the people to sit in groups of about 50 people . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the followers did this and everyone sat down .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He looked up into the sky and thanked God for the food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he broke it into pieces , which he gave to the followers to give to the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all ate until they were full .|||O O O O O O O O
And there was a lot of food left .|||O O O O O O O O O
Twelve baskets were filled with the pieces of food that were not eaten .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One time Jesus was praying alone .|||O O O O O O O
His followers came together there , and he asked them , `` Who do the people say I am ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They answered , `` Some people say you are John the Baptizer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Others say you are Elijah .|||O O O O O O
And some people say you are one of the prophets from long ago that has come back to life . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said to his followers , `` And who do you say I am ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter answered , `` You are the Christ from God . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus warned them not to tell anyone .|||O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said , `` The Son of Man must suffer many things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He will be rejected by the older Jewish leaders , the leading priests , and teachers of the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he will be killed .|||O O O O O O
But after three days he will be raised from death . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus continued to say to all of them , `` Any of you who want to be my follower must stop thinking about yourself and what you want .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must be willing to carry the cross that is given to you every day for following me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Any of you who try to save the life you have will lose it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you who give up your life for me will save it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is worth nothing for you to have the whole world if you yourself are destroyed or lost .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't be ashamed of me and my teaching .|||O O O O O O O O O O
If that happens , I will be ashamed of you when I come with my divine greatness and that of the Father and the holy angels .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Believe me when I say that some of you people standing here will see God 's kingdom before you die . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
About eight days after Jesus said these things , he took Peter , John , and James and went up on a mountain to pray .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While Jesus was praying , his face began to change .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
His clothes became shining white .|||O O O O O O
Then two men were there , talking with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They were Moses and Elijah .|||O O O O O O
They also looked bright and glorious .|||O O O O O O O
They were talking with Jesus about his death that would happen in Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter and the others were asleep .|||O O O O O O O
But they woke up and saw the glory of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They also saw the two men who were standing with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Moses and Elijah were leaving , Peter said , ``|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Master , it is good that we are here .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We will put three tents here -- one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- He did not know what he was saying . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O
While Peter was saying these things , a cloud came all around them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter , John , and James were afraid when the cloud covered them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A voice came from the cloud and said , `` This is my Son .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the one I have chosen .|||O O O O O O O O
Obey him . ''|||O O O O
When the voice stopped , only Jesus was there .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Peter , John , and James said nothing .|||O O O O O O O O O
And for a long time after that , they told no one about what they had seen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The next day , Jesus , Peter , John , and James came down from the mountain .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A large group of people met Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O
A man in the group shouted to him , `` Teacher , please come and look at my son .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the only child I have .|||O O O O O O O O
An evil spirit comes into him , and then he shouts .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He loses control of himself and foams at the mouth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The evil spirit continues to hurt him and almost never leaves him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I begged your followers to make the evil spirit leave my son , but they could not do it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` You people today have no faith .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Your lives are all wrong .|||O O O O O O
How long must I be with you and be patient with you ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus said to the man , `` Bring your son here . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the boy was coming , the demon threw the boy to the ground .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The boy lost control of himself .|||O O O O O O O
But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the boy was healed , and Jesus gave him back to his father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the people were amazed at the great power of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people were still amazed about all the things Jesus did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to his followers , `` Do n't forget what I will tell you now : The Son of Man will soon be handed over to the control of other men . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the followers did not understand what he meant .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The meaning was hidden from them so that they could not understand it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they were afraid to ask Jesus about what he said .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus ' followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus knew what they were thinking , so he took a little child and stood the child beside him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he said to the followers , `` Whoever accepts a little child like this in my name is accepting me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And anyone who accepts me is also accepting the one who sent me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The one among you who is the most humble -- this is the one who is great . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
John answered , `` Master , we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We told him to stop because he does not belong to our group . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to him , `` Do n't stop him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Whoever is not against you is for you . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
The time was coming near when Jesus would leave and go back to heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He decided to go to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O
He sent some men ahead of him .|||O O O O O O O O
They went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the people there would not welcome Jesus because he was going toward Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
James and John , the followers of Jesus , saw this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Lord , do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus turned and criticized them for saying this .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then he and his followers went to another town .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They were all traveling along the road .|||O O O O O O O O
Someone said to Jesus , `` I will follow you anywhere you go . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` The foxes have holes to live in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The birds have nests .|||O O O O O
But the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to another man , `` Follow me ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the man said , `` Lord , let me go and bury my father first . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus said to him , `` Let the people who are dead bury their own dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must go and tell about God 's kingdom . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Another man said , `` I will follow you , Lord , but first let me go and say goodbye to my family . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Anyone who begins to plow a field but looks back is not prepared for God 's kingdom . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus was going through the city of Jericho .|||O O O O O O O O O
In Jericho there was a man named Zacchaeus .|||O O O O O O O O O
He was a wealthy , very important tax collector .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He wanted to see who Jesus was .|||O O O O O O O O
There were many others who wanted to see Jesus too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Zacchaeus was too short to see above the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So he ran to a place where he knew Jesus would come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Jesus came to where Zacchaeus was , he looked up and saw him in the tree .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Zacchaeus , hurry !|||O O O O O O O O
Come down !|||O O O
I must stay at your house today . ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Zacchaeus hurried and came down .|||O O O O O O
He was happy to have Jesus in his house .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone saw this .|||O O O O
They began to complain , `` Look at the kind of man Jesus is staying with .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Zacchaeus is a sinner ! ''|||O O O O O O
Zacchaeus said to the Lord , `` I want to do good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will give half of my money to the poor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If I have cheated anyone , I will pay them back four times more . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` Today is the day for this family to be saved from sin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , even this tax collector is one of God 's chosen people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the crowd listened to what he was saying , Jesus went on to tell a story .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was now near Jerusalem and knew that the people thought it was almost time for God 's kingdom to come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he said , `` A very important man was preparing to go to a country far away to be made a king .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he planned to return home and rule his people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So he called ten of his servants together .|||O O O O O O O O O
He gave a bag of money to each servant .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He said , ' Do business with this money until I come back . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the people in the kingdom hated the man .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They sent a group to follow him to the other country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There they said , ' We do n't want this man to be our king . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` But the man was made king .|||O O O O O O O O
When he came home , he said , ' Call those servants who have my money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I want to know how much more money they earned with it . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first servant came and said , ' Sir , I earned ten bags of money with the one bag you gave me . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The king said to him , ' That 's great !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
You are a good servant .|||O O O O O O
I see that I can trust you with small things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So now I will let you rule over ten of my cities . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` The second servant said , ' Sir , with your one bag of money I earned five bags . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The king said to this servant , ' You can rule over five cities . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` Then another servant came in and said to the king , ' Sir , here is your bag of money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wrapped it in a piece of cloth and hid it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was afraid of you because you are a hard man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
You even take money that you did n't earn and gather food that you did n't grow . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` Then the king said to him , ' What a bad servant you are !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will use your own words to condemn you .|||O O O O O O O O O O
You said that I am a hard man .|||O O O O O O O O O
You said that I even take money that I did n't earn and gather food that I did n't grow .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If that is true , you should have put my money in the bank .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then , when I came back , my money would have earned some interest . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the king said to the men who were watching , ' Take the bag of money away from this servant and give it to the servant who earned ten bags of money . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` The men said to the king , ' But sir , that servant already has ten bags of money . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
`` The king said , ' People who use what they have will get more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But those who do not use what they have will have everything taken away from them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now where are my enemies ?|||O O O O O O
Where are the people who did not want me to be king ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bring my enemies here and kill them .|||O O O O O O O O
I will watch them die . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O
After Jesus said these things , he continued traveling toward Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He came near Bethphage and Bethany , towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He sent out two of his followers .|||O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Go into the town you can see there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When you enter the town , you will find a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Untie it , and bring it here to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O
If anyone asks you why you are taking the donkey , you should say , ' The Master needs it . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The two followers went into town .|||O O O O O O O
They found the donkey exactly like Jesus told them .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They untied it , but its owners came out .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They said to the followers , `` Why are you untying our donkey ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers answered , `` The Master needs it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So the followers brought the donkey to Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O
They put their coats on its back .|||O O O O O O O O
Then they put Jesus on the donkey .|||O O O O O O O O
He rode along the road toward Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O
The followers spread their coats on the road before him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus was coming close to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O
He was already near the bottom of the Mount of Olives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The whole group of followers was happy .|||O O O O O O O O
They were very excited and praised God .|||O O O O O O O O
They thanked God for all the powerful things they had seen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` ' Welcome !|||O O O O O O O
God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peace in heaven and glory to God ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O
Some of the Pharisees said to Jesus , `` Teacher , tell your followers not to say these things . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus answered , `` I tell you , if my followers did n't say them , these stones would shout them . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus came near Jerusalem .|||O O O O O
Looking at the city , he began to cry for it and said , `` I wish you knew today what would bring you peace .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But it is hidden from you now .|||O O O O O O O O
A time is coming when your enemies will build a wall around you and hold you in on all sides .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will destroy you and all your people .|||O O O O O O O O O
Not one stone of your buildings will stay on top of another .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All this will happen because you did not know the time when God came to save you . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus went into the Temple area .|||O O O O O O O
He began to throw out the people who were selling things there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` The Scriptures say , ' My Temple will be a house of prayer . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you have changed it into a ' hiding place for thieves . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus taught the people in the Temple area every day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The leading priests , the teachers of the law , and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But they did not know how they could do it , because everyone was listening to him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people were very interested in what Jesus said .|||O O O O O O O O O O
While Jesus was walking , he saw a man who had been blind since the time he was born .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus ' followers asked him , `` Teacher , why was this man born blind ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whose sin made it happen ?|||O O O O O O
Was it his own sin or that of his parents ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` It was not any sin of this man or his parents that caused him to be blind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was born blind so that he could be used to show what great things God can do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the one who sent me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The night is coming , and no one can work at night .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After Jesus said this , he spit on the dirt , made some mud and put it on the man 's eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus told him , `` Go and wash in Siloam pool . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- Siloam means `` Sent . '' -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O
So the man went to the pool , washed and came back .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was now able to see .|||O O O O O O O
His neighbors and some others who had seen him begging said , `` Look !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is this the same man who always sits and begs ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some people said , `` Yes !|||O O O O O O O
He is the one . ''|||O O O O O O
But others said , `` No , he ca n't be the same man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He only looks like him . ''|||O O O O O O O
So the man himself said , `` I am that same man . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They asked , `` What happened ?|||O O O O O O O
How did you get your sight ? ''|||O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So I went there and washed .|||O O O O O O O
And then I could see . ''|||O O O O O O O
They asked him , `` Where is this man ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` I do n't know . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Then the people brought the man to the Pharisees .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The day Jesus had made mud and healed the man 's eyes was a Sabbath day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the Pharisees asked the man , `` How did you get your sight ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` He put mud on my eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I washed , and now I can see . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the Pharisees said , `` That man does not obey the law about the Sabbath day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So he is not from God . ''|||O O O O O O O O
Others said , `` But someone who is a sinner can not do these miraculous signs . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they could not agree with each other .|||O O O O O O O O O
They asked the man again , `` Since it was your eyes he healed , what do you say about him ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` He is a prophet . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish leaders still did not believe that this really happened to the man -- that he was blind and was now healed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But later they sent for his parents .|||O O O O O O O O
They asked them , `` Is this your son ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
You say he was born blind .|||O O O O O O O
So how can he see ? ''|||O O O O O O O
His parents answered , `` We know that this man is our son .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And we know that he was born blind .|||O O O O O O O O O
But we do n't know why he can see now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We do n't know who healed his eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O
Ask him .|||O O O
He is old enough to answer for himself . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
They said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The leaders had already decided that they would punish anyone who said Jesus was the Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They would stop them from coming to the synagogue .|||O O O O O O O O O O
That is why his parents said , `` He is old enough .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ask him . ''|||O O O O
So the Jewish leaders called the man who had been blind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told him to come in again .|||O O O O O O O O
They said , `` You should honor God by telling the truth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We know that this man is a sinner . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
The man answered , `` I do n't know if he is a sinner .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I do know this : I was blind , and now I can see . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They asked , `` What did he do to you ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
How did he heal your eyes ? ''|||O O O O O O O O
He answered , `` I have already told you that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But you would not listen to me .|||O O O O O O O O
Why do you want to hear it again ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Do you want to be his followers too ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
At this they shouted insults at him and said , `` You are his follower , not us !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We are followers of Moses .|||O O O O O O
We know that God spoke to Moses .|||O O O O O O O O
But we do n't even know where this man comes from ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man answered , `` This is really strange !|||O O O O O O O O O O
You do n't know where he comes from , but he healed my eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he will listen to anyone who worships and obeys him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first time we have ever heard of anyone healing the eyes of someone born blind .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This man must be from God .|||O O O O O O O
If he were not from God , he could not do anything like this . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish leaders answered , `` You were born full of sin !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you trying to teach us ? ''|||O O O O O O O O
And they told the man to get out of the synagogue and to stay out .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Jesus heard that they had forced the man to leave , he found him and asked him , `` Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man said , `` Tell me who he is , sir , so I can believe in him . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said to him , `` You have already seen him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Son of Man is the one talking with you now . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The man answered , `` Yes , I believe , Lord ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he bowed and worshiped Jesus .|||O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` I came into this world so that the world could be judged .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I came so that people who are blind could see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And I came so that people who think they see would become blind . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the Pharisees were near Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O
They heard him say this .|||O O O O O O
They asked , `` What ?|||O O O O O O
Are you saying that we are blind too ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus said , `` If you were really blind , you would not be guilty of sin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you say that you see , so you are still guilty . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The soldiers made a crown from thorny branches and put it on his head .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then they put a purple robe around him .|||O O O O O O O O O
They kept coming up to him and saying , `` Hail to the king of the Jews ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they hit him in the face .|||O O O O O O O O
Again Pilate came out and said to the Jewish leaders , `` Look !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am bringing Jesus out to you .|||O O O O O O O O
I want you to know that I find nothing I can charge him with . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is the man ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the leading priests and the Jewish guards saw Jesus they shouted , `` Kill him on a cross !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Kill him on a cross ! ''|||O O O O O O O
But Pilate answered , `` You take him and nail him to a cross yourselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I find nothing I can charge him with . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish leaders answered , `` We have a law that says he must die , because he said he is the Son of God . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Pilate heard this , he was more afraid .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So he went back inside the palace and asked Jesus , `` Where are you from ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Jesus did not answer him .|||O O O O O O O
Pilate said , `` You refuse to speak to me ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Remember , I have the power to make you free or to kill you on a cross . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus answered , `` The only power you have over me is the power given to you by God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After this , Pilate tried to let Jesus go free .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the Jewish leaders shouted , `` Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So if you let this man go free , that means you are not Caesar 's friend . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When Pilate heard this , he brought Jesus out to the place called `` The Stone Pavement . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- In Aramaic the name is Gabbatha . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O
Pilate sat down on the judge 's seat there .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It was now almost noon on Preparation day of Passover week .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pilate said to the Jews , `` Here is your king ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They shouted , `` Take him away !|||O O O O O O O O
Take him away !|||O O O O
Kill him on a cross ! ''|||O O O O O O O
Pilate asked them , `` Do you want me to kill your king on a cross ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The leading priests answered , `` The only king we have is Caesar ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be killed on a cross .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The soldiers took Jesus .|||O O O O O
He carried his own cross to a place called `` The Place of the Skull . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- In Aramaic the name of this place is `` Golgotha . '' -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There they nailed Jesus to the cross .|||O O O O O O O O
They also nailed two other men to crosses .|||O O O O O O O O O
They put them on each side of Jesus with him in the middle .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pilate told them to write a sign and put it on the cross .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sign said , `` jesus of nazareth , the king of the jews . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sign was written in Aramaic , in Latin , and in Greek .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many of the Jews read this sign , because the place where Jesus was nailed to the cross was near the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The leading Jewish priests said to Pilate , `` Do n't write , ' The King of the Jews . '|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But write , ' This man said , I am the King of the Jews . ' ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pilate answered , `` I will not change what I have written . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross , they took his clothes and divided them into four parts .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Each soldier got one part .|||O O O O O O
They also took his tunic .|||O O O O O O
It was all one piece of cloth woven from top to bottom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the soldiers said to each other , `` We should not tear this into parts .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let 's throw lots to see who will get it . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
This happened to make clear the full meaning of what the Scriptures say : `` They divided my clothes among them , and they threw lots for what I was wearing . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the soldiers did this .|||O O O O O O
Jesus ' mother stood near his cross .|||O O O O O O O O
Her sister was also standing there with Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Jesus saw his mother .|||O O O O O
He also saw the follower he loved very much standing there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said to his mother , `` Dear woman , here is your son . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he said to the follower , `` Here is your mother . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So after that , this follower took Jesus ' mother to live in his home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Later , Jesus knew that everything had been done .|||O O O O O O O O O O
To make the Scriptures come true he said , `` I am thirsty . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a jar full of sour wine there , so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant and lifted it to Jesus ' mouth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When he tasted the wine , he said , `` It is finished . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he bowed his head and died .|||O O O O O O O O
This day was Preparation day .|||O O O O O O
The next day was a special Sabbath day .|||O O O O O O O O O
The Jewish leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they asked that the bodies be taken down from the crosses .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men on the crosses beside Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But when the soldiers came close to Jesus , they saw that he was already dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they did not break his legs .|||O O O O O O O O
But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus '|||O O O O O O O O O O O
side .|||O O
Immediately blood and water came out .|||O O O O O O O
-LRB- The one who saw this happen has told about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told about it so that you also can believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The things he says are true .|||O O O O O O O
He knows that he tells the truth . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O
These things happened to give full meaning to the Scriptures that said , `` None of his bones will be broken ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and `` People will look at the one they stabbed . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Later , a man named Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- Joseph was a follower of Jesus , but he did not tell anyone , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pilate said Joseph could take Jesus ' body , so he came and took it away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nicodemus went with Joseph .|||O O O O O
He was the man who had come to Jesus before and talked to him at night .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He brought about 100 pounds of spices -- a mixture of myrrh and aloes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These two men took Jesus ' body and wrapped it in pieces of linen cloth with the spices .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- This is how the Jews bury people . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O
In the place where Jesus was killed on the cross , there was a garden .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the garden there was a new tomb .|||O O O O O O O O O
No one had ever been buried there before .|||O O O O O O O O O
The men put Jesus in that tomb because it was near , and the Jews were preparing to start their Sabbath day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Jerusalem Saul was still trying to scare the followers of the Lord , even saying he would kill them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He went to the high priest and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Saul wanted the high priest to give him the authority to find people in Damascus who were followers of the Way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If he found any believers there , men or women , he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Saul went to Damascus .|||O O O O O O
When he came near the city , a very bright light from heaven suddenly shined around him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , `` Saul , Saul !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why are you persecuting me ? ''|||O O O O O O O
Saul said , `` Who are you , Lord ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The voice answered , `` I am Jesus , the one you are persecuting .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Get up now and go into the city .|||O O O O O O O O O
Someone there will tell you what you must do . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The men traveling with Saul just stood there , unable to speak .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They heard the voice , but they saw no one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes , but he could not see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the men with him held his hand and led him into Damascus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For three days Saul could not see ; he did not eat or drink .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
In a vision the Lord said to him , `` Ananias ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ananias answered , `` Here I am , Lord . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The Lord said to him , `` Get up and go to the street called Straight Street .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Find the house of Judas and ask for a man named Saul from the city of Tarsus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is there now , praying .|||O O O O O O O
He has seen a vision in which a man named Ananias came and laid his hands on him so that he could see again . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Ananias answered , `` Lord , many people have told me about this man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They told me about the many bad things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now he has come here to Damascus .|||O O O O O O O O
The leading priests have given him the power to arrest all people who trust in you . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the Lord Jesus said to Ananias , `` Go !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I have chosen Saul for an important work .|||O O O O O O O O O
He must tell about me to other nations and their rulers and to the people of Israel .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will show him all that he must suffer for me . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Ananias left and went to the house of Judas .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He laid his hands on Saul and said , `` Saul , my brother , the Lord Jesus sent me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the one you saw on the road when you came here .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He sent me so that you can see again and also be filled with the Holy Spirit . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immediately , something that looked like fish scales fell off Saul 's eyes .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was able to see !|||O O O O O O
Then he got up and was baptized .|||O O O O O O O O
After he ate , he began to feel strong again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Soon he began to go to the synagogues and tell people about Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told the people , `` Jesus is the Son of God ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the people who heard Saul were amazed .|||O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` This is the same man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy the people who trust in Jesus !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And that 's why he has come here -- to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Saul became more and more powerful in proving that Jesus is the Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His proofs were so strong that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not argue with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After many days , some Jews made plans to kill Saul .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were watching the city gates day and night .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They wanted to kill Saul , but he learned about their plan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One night some followers that Saul had taught helped him leave the city .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They put him in a basket and lowered it down through a hole in the city wall .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Saul went to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O
He tried to join the group of followers , but they were all afraid of him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not believe that he was really a follower of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to Saul .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he told them how boldly Saul had spoken for the Lord in Damascus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And so Saul stayed with the followers and went all around Jerusalem speaking boldly for the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He often had arguments with the Greek - speaking Jews , who began making plans to kill him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the believers learned about this , they took Saul to Caesarea , and from there they sent him to the city of Tarsus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The church in Judea , Galilee , and Samaria had a time of peace .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With the help of the Holy Spirit , the groups of believers became stronger and showed their respect for the Lord by the way they lived .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So the church everywhere grew in numbers .|||O O O O O O O O
Peter was traveling through all the areas around Jerusalem , and he stopped to visit the believers who lived in Lydda .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There he met a man named Aeneas , who was paralyzed and had not been able to get out of bed for the past eight years .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter said to him , `` Aeneas , Jesus Christ heals you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Get up and make your bed ! ''|||O O O O O O O O
He stood up immediately .|||O O O O O
All the people living in Lydda and on the plain of Sharon saw him , and they decided to follow the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the city of Joppa there was a follower of Jesus named Tabitha .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her Greek name , Dorcas , means `` a deer . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
She was always doing good things for people and giving money to those in need .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While Peter was in Lydda , Tabitha became sick and died .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They washed her body and put it in an upstairs room .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda , which was not far away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they sent two men , who begged him , `` Hurry , please come quickly ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter got ready and went with them .|||O O O O O O O O
When he arrived , they took him to the upstairs room .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the widows stood around him .|||O O O O O O O
They were crying and showing him the coats and other clothes that Tabitha had made during her time with them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter sent all the people out of the room .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He knelt down and prayed .|||O O O O O O
Then he turned to Tabitha 's body and said , `` Tabitha , stand up ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She opened her eyes .|||O O O O O
When she saw Peter , she sat up .|||O O O O O O O O O
He gave her his hand and helped her stand up .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he called the believers and the widows into the room .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He showed them Tabitha ; she was alive !|||O O O O O O O O O
People everywhere in Joppa learned about this , and many believed in the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Peter stayed in Joppa for many days at the home of a man named Simon , who was a leatherworker .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While Apollos was in the city of Corinth , Paul was visiting some places on his way to Ephesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Ephesus he found some other followers of the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He asked them , `` Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These followers said to him , `` We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul asked them , `` So what kind of baptism did you have ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` It was the baptism that John taught . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul said , `` John told people to be baptized to show they wanted to change their lives .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told people to believe in the one who would come after him , and that one is Jesus . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When these followers heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then Paul laid his hands on them , and the Holy Spirit came on them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They began speaking different languages and prophesying .|||O O O O O O O O
There were about twelve men in this group .|||O O O O O O O O O
Paul went into the synagogue and spoke very boldly .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He continued doing this for three months .|||O O O O O O O O
He talked with the Jews , trying to persuade them to accept what he was telling them about God 's kingdom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But some of them became stubborn and refused to believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
In front of everyone , they said bad things about the Way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Paul left these Jews and took the Lord 's followers with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He went to a place where a man named Tyrannus had a school .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There Paul talked with people every day .|||O O O O O O O O
He did this for two years .|||O O O O O O O
Because of this work , everyone in Asia , Jews and Greeks , heard the word of the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God used Paul to do some very special miracles .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Some people carried away handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on those who were sick .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sick people were healed , and evil spirits left them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some Jews also were traveling around forcing evil spirits out of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The seven sons of Sceva , one of the leading priests , were doing this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These Jews tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to make the evil spirits go out of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all said , `` By the same Jesus that Paul talks about , I order you to come out ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But one time an evil spirit said to these Jews , `` I know Jesus , and I know about Paul , but who are you ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the man who had the evil spirit inside him jumped on these Jews .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was much stronger than all of them .|||O O O O O O O O O
He beat them up and tore their clothes off .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They all ran away from that house .|||O O O O O O O O
All the people in Ephesus , Jews and Greeks , learned about this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were all filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many of the believers began to confess , telling about all the evil things they had done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of them had used magic .|||O O O O O O O
These believers brought their magic books and burned them before everyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
These books were worth about 50 , 000 silver coins .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This is how the word of the Lord was spreading in a powerful way , causing more and more people to believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After this , Paul made plans to go to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He planned to go through the regions of Macedonia and Achaia , and then go to Jerusalem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He thought , `` After I visit Jerusalem , I must also visit Rome . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Timothy and Erastus were two of his helpers .|||O O O O O O O O O
Paul sent them ahead to Macedonia .|||O O O O O O O
But he stayed in Asia for a while .|||O O O O O O O O O
But during that time there was some trouble in Ephesus about the Way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is how it all happened : There was a man named Demetrius .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He worked with silver .|||O O O O O
He made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The men who did this work made a lot of money .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Demetrius had a meeting with these men and some others who did the same kind of work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He told them , `` Men , you know that we make a lot of money from our business .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But look at what this man Paul is doing .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Listen to what he is saying .|||O O O O O O O
He has convinced many people in Ephesus and all over Asia to change their religion .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He says the gods that people make by hand are not real .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm afraid this is going to turn people against our business .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But there is also another problem .|||O O O O O O O
People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Her greatness will be destroyed .|||O O O O O O
And Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the men heard this , they became very angry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They shouted , `` Great is Artemis , the goddess of Ephesus ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The whole city was thrown into confusion .|||O O O O O O O O
The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus , men from Macedonia who were traveling with Paul , and rushed all together into the stadium .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Paul wanted to go in and talk to the people , but the Lord 's followers did not let him go .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , some leaders of the country who were friends of Paul sent him a message telling him not to go into the stadium .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some people were shouting one thing and others were shouting something else .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The meeting was very confused .|||O O O O O O
Most of the people did not know why they had come there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some Jews made a man named Alexander stand before the crowd , and they told him what to say .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alexander waved his hand , trying to explain things to the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But when the people saw that Alexander was a Jew , they all began shouting the same thing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For two hours they continued shouting , `` Great is Artemis of Ephesus !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great is Artemis of Ephesus !|||O O O O O O
Great is Artemis . . . ! ''|||O O O O O O O O
Then the city clerk persuaded the people to be quiet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He said , `` Men of Ephesus , everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone knows that we also keep her holy rock .|||O O O O O O O O O O
No one can deny this , so you should be quiet .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
You must stop and think before you do anything else .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
`` You brought these men here , but they have not said anything bad against our goddess .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have not stolen anything from her temple .|||O O O O O O O O O
We have courts of law and there are judges .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Do Demetrius and those men who work with him have a charge against anyone ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They should go to the courts .|||O O O O O O O
Let them argue with each other there .|||O O O O O O O O
`` Is there something else you want to talk about ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Then come to the regular town meeting of the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
It can be decided there .|||O O O O O O
I say this because someone might see this trouble today and say we are rioting .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We could not explain all this trouble , because there is no real reason for this meeting . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the city clerk said this , he told the people to go home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am in Christ and I am telling you the truth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am not lying .|||O O O O O
And my conscience , ruled by the Holy Spirit , agrees that what I say now is true .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness for my own people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are my brothers and sisters , my earthly family .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I wish I could help them .|||O O O O O O O
I would even have a curse on me and cut myself off from Christ if that would help them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are the people of Israel , God 's chosen children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have the glory of God and the agreements he made between himself and his people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God gave them the Law of Moses , the Temple worship , and his promises .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are the descendants of our great fathers , and they are the earthly family of Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And Christ is God over all things .|||O O O O O O O O
Praise him forever !|||O O O O
Amen .|||O O
I do n't mean that God failed to keep his promise to the Jewish people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But only some of the people of Israel are really God 's people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And only some of Abraham 's descendants are true children of Abraham .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is what God said to Abraham : `` Your true descendants will be those who come through Isaac . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This means that not all of Abraham 's descendants are God 's true children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Abraham 's true children are those who become God 's children because of the promise he made to Abraham .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here is what God said in that promise : `` About this time next year I will come back , and Sarah will have a son . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And that is not all .|||O O O O O O
Rebecca also had sons , and they had the same father .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He is our father Isaac .|||O O O O O O
But before the two sons were born , God told Rebecca , `` The older son will serve the younger . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was before the boys had done anything good or bad .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
God said this before they were born so that the boy he wanted would be chosen because of God 's own plan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call , not because of anything the boys did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the Scriptures say , `` I loved Jacob , but I hated Esau . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what does this mean ?|||O O O O O O
That God is not fair ?|||O O O O O O
We can not say that .|||O O O O O O
God said to Moses , `` I will show mercy to anyone I want to show mercy to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I will show pity to anyone I choose . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O
So God will choose anyone he decides to show mercy to , and his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the Scriptures God says to Pharaoh : `` I made you king so that you could do this for me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wanted to show my power through you .|||O O O O O O O O O
I wanted my name to be announced throughout the world . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
So God shows mercy to those he wants to show mercy to and makes stubborn those he wants to make stubborn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So one of you will ask me , `` If God controls what we do , why does he blame us for our sins ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't ask that .|||O O O O O
You are only human and have no right to question God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
A clay jar does not question the one who made it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
It does not say , `` Why did you make me like this ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The one who makes the jar can make anything he wants .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He uses the same clay to make different things .|||O O O O O O O O O O
He might make one thing for special purposes and another for daily use .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is the same way with what God has done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he patiently endured those he was angry with -- people who were ready to be destroyed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He waited with patience so that he could make known the riches of his glory to the people he has chosen to receive his mercy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God has already prepared them to share his glory .|||O O O O O O O O O O
We are those people , the ones God chose not only from the Jews but also from those who are not Jews .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As the Scriptures say in the book of Hosea , `` The people who are not mine -- I will say they are my people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the people I did not love -- I will say they are the people I love . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And , `` Where God said in the past , ' You are not my people ' -- there they will be called children of the living God . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And Isaiah cries out about Israel : `` There are so many people of Israel , they are like the grains of sand by the sea .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But only a few of them will be saved .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , the Lord will quickly finish judging the people on the earth . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is just as Isaiah said : `` The Lord All - Powerful allowed some of our people to live .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If he had not done that , we would now be like Sodom , and we would be like Gomorrah . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what does all this mean ?|||O O O O O O O
It means that people who are not Jews were made right with God because of their faith , even though they were not trying to make themselves right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the people of Israel , who tried to make themselves right with God by following the law , did not succeed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They failed because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not trust in God to make them right .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
They fell over the stone that makes people fall .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Scriptures talk about that stone : `` Look , I put in Zion a stone that will make people stumble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is a rock that will make people fall .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am a free man .|||O O O O O O
I am an apostle .|||O O O O O
I have seen Jesus our Lord .|||O O O O O O O
You people are an example of my work in the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Others may not accept me as an apostle , but surely you do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some people want to judge me .|||O O O O O O O
So this is the answer I give them : We have the right to eat and drink , do n't we ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel , do n't we ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other apostles and the Lord 's brothers and Peter all do this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes himself .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No one takes care of a flock of sheep without drinking some of the milk himself .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These are n't just my own thoughts .|||O O O O O O O O
God 's law says the same thing .|||O O O O O O O O
Yes , it is written in the Law of Moses : ``|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
When a work animal is being used to separate grain , do n't keep it from eating the grain . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When God said this , was he thinking only about work animals ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No .|||O O
He was really talking about us .|||O O O O O O O
Yes , that was written for us .|||O O O O O O O O
The one who plows and the one who separates the grain should both expect to get some of the grain for their work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We planted spiritual seed among you , so we should be able to harvest from you some things for this life .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Surely that is not asking too much .|||O O O O O O O O
Others have this right to get things from you .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So surely we have this right too .|||O O O O O O O O
But we do n't use this right .|||O O O O O O O O
No , we endure everything ourselves so that we will not stop anyone from obeying the Good News of Christ .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is the same with those who have the work of telling the Good News .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I have not used any of these rights , and I am not trying to get anything from you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is not my purpose for writing this .|||O O O O O O O O O
I would rather die than to have someone take away what for me is a great source of pride .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's not my work of telling the Good News that gives me any reason to boast .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is my duty -- something I must do .|||O O O O O O O O O O
If I do n't tell people the Good News , I am in real trouble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If I did it because it was my own choice , I would deserve to be paid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I have no choice .|||O O O O O O
I must tell the Good News .|||O O O O O O O
So I am only doing the duty that was given to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what do I get for doing it ?|||O O O O O O O O O
My reward is that when I tell people the Good News I can offer it to them for free and not use the rights that come with doing this work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am free .|||O O O O
I belong to no other person , but I make myself a slave to everyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do this to help save as many people as I can .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To the Jews I became like a Jew so that I could help save Jews .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I myself am not ruled by the law , but to those who are ruled by the law I became like someone who is ruled by the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did this to help save those who are ruled by the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To those who are without the law I became like someone who is without the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did this to help save those who are without the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- But really , I am not without God 's law -- I am ruled by the law of Christ . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To those who are weak , I became weak so that I could help save them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have become all things to all people .|||O O O O O O O O O
I did this so that I could save people in any way possible .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do all this to make the Good News known .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I do it so that I can share in the blessings of the Good News .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know that in a race all the runners run , but only one runner gets the prize .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So run like that .|||O O O O O
Run to win !|||O O O O
All who compete in the games use strict training .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They do this so that they can win a prize -- one that does n't last .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But our prize is one that will last forever .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So I run like someone who has a goal .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I fight like a boxer who is hitting something , not just the air .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is my own body I fight to make it do what I want .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do this so that I wo n't miss getting the prize myself after telling others about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I really do n't need to write to you about this help for God 's people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know that you want to help .|||O O O O O O O O
I have been bragging about you to the people in Macedonia .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I told them that you people in Achaia have been ready to give since last year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And your desire to give has made most of the people here ready to give also .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I am sending the brothers to you .|||O O O O O O O O O
I do n't want our bragging about you in this to be for nothing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I want you to be ready just as I said you would be .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If any of those from Macedonia come with me , and they find that you are not ready , we will be ashamed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We will be ashamed that we were so sure of you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And you will be ashamed too !|||O O O O O O O
So I thought that I should ask these brothers to come there before we do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will help in getting together the generous gift you promised .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then it will be ready when we come , and it will be seen as a blessing you are giving , not as something you were forced to do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Remember this : The one who plants few seeds will have a small harvest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the one who plants a lot will have a big harvest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Each one of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You should not give if it makes you unhappy or if you feel forced to give .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God loves those who are happy to give .|||O O O O O O O O O
And God can give you more blessings than you need , and you will always have plenty of everything .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You will have enough to give to every good work .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
As the Scriptures say , `` He gives generously to the poor ; his goodness will continue forever . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God is the one who gives seed to those who plant , and he gives bread for food .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And God will give you spiritual seed and make that seed grow .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He will produce a great harvest from your goodness .|||O O O O O O O O O O
God will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And your giving through us will make people give thanks to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service you are offering helps God 's people with their needs , but that is not all it does .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is also bringing more and more thanks to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This service is a proof of your faith , and people will praise God because of it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will praise him because you are following the message about Christ -- the message you say you believe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will praise God because you freely share with them and with all people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And when they pray , they will wish they could be with you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will feel this way because of the great grace that God gave you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful to describe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first agreement had rules for worship and a place for worship here on earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place was inside a tent .|||O O O O O O O
The first area in the tent was called the Holy Place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the Holy Place were the lamp and the table with the special bread offered to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the Most Holy Place was a golden altar for burning incense .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And also there was the Box of the Agreement .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The Box was covered with gold .|||O O O O O O O
Inside this Box was a golden jar of manna and Aaron 's rod -- the rod that once grew leaves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also in the Box were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments of the old agreement on them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Above the Box were the Cherub angels that showed God 's glory .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These Cherub angels were over the place of mercy .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But we can not say everything about this now .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Everything in the tent was made ready in the way I have explained .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the priests went into the first room every day to do their worship duties .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But only the high priest could go into the second room , and he went in only once a year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , he could never enter that room without taking blood with him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He offered that blood to God for himself and for the sins the people committed without knowing they were sinning .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Holy Spirit uses those two separate rooms to teach us that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the first room was still there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is an example for us today .|||O O O O O O O O
It shows that the gifts and sacrifices the priests offer to God are not able to make the consciences of the worshipers completely clear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These gifts and sacrifices are only about food and drink and special washings .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are only rules about the body .|||O O O O O O O O
God gave them for his people to follow until the time of his new way .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Christ has already come to be the high priest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He is the high priest of the good things we now have .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But Christ does not serve in a place like the tent that those other priests served in .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He serves in a better place .|||O O O O O O O
Unlike that tent , this one is perfect .|||O O O O O O O O O
It was not made by anyone here on earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It does not belong to this world .|||O O O O O O O O
Christ entered the Most Holy Place only one time -- enough for all time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He entered the Most Holy Place by using his own blood , not the blood of goats or young bulls .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He entered there and made us free from sin forever .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow were sprinkled on those who were no longer pure enough to enter the place of worship .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood and ashes made them pure again -- but only their bodies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So surely the blood sacrifice of Christ can do much more .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His blood will make us completely clean from the evil we have done .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It will give us clear consciences so that we can worship the living God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He brings this agreement so that those who are chosen by God can have the blessings God promised , blessings that last forever .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This can happen only because Christ died to free people from sins committed against the commands of the first agreement .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When someone dies and leaves a will , there must be proof that the one who wrote the will is dead .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A will means nothing while the one who wrote it is still living .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It can be used only after that person 's death .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
That is why blood was needed to begin the first agreement between God and his people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
First , Moses told the people every command in the law .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he took the blood of young bulls and mixed it with water .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He used red wool and a branch of hyssop to sprinkle the blood and water on the book of the law and on all the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then he said , `` This is the blood that makes the agreement good -- the agreement that God commanded you to follow . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the same way , Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He sprinkled the blood over everything used in worship .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sins can not be forgiven without a blood sacrifice .|||O O O O O O O O O O
These things are copies of the real things that are in heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These copies had to be made clean by animal sacrifices .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
But the real things in heaven must have much better sacrifices .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ went into the Most Holy Place .|||O O O O O O O O
But it was not the man - made one , which is only a copy of the real one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He went into heaven , and he is there now before God to help us .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He takes with him blood to offer .|||O O O O O O O O
But he does not offer his own blood like Christ did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Christ went into heaven , but not to offer himself many times like the high priest offers blood again and again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If Christ had offered himself many times , he would have needed to suffer many times since the time the world was made .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he came to offer himself only once .|||O O O O O O O O O
And that once is enough for all time .|||O O O O O O O O O
He came at a time when the world is nearing an end .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He came to take away all sin by offering himself as a sacrifice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone must die once .|||O O O O O
Then they are judged .|||O O O O O
So Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he will come a second time , but not to offer himself for sin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He will come the second time to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fifth angel blew his trumpet .|||O O O O O O O
Then I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads down to the bottomless pit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the star opened the hole leading to the pit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then locusts came out of the smoke and went down to the earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were given the power to sting like scorpions .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They were told not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were to hurt only those who did not have God 's mark on their foreheads .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were not given the power to kill them but only to cause them pain for five months -- pain like a person feels when stung by a scorpion .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During those days people will look for a way to die , but they will not find it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They will want to die , but death will hide from them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle .|||O O O O O O O O O
On their heads they wore something that looked like a gold crown .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their faces looked like human faces .|||O O O O O O O
Their hair was like women 's hair .|||O O O O O O O O
Their teeth were like lions ' teeth .|||O O O O O O O O
Their chests looked like iron breastplates .|||O O O O O O O
The sound their wings made was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions .|||O O O O O O O O O
The power they had to give people pain for five months was in their tails .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They had a ruler , who was the angel of the bottomless pit .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His name in Hebrew is Abaddon .|||O O O O O O O
In Greek it is Apollyon .|||O O O O O O
The first terror is now past .|||O O O O O O O
There are still two other terrors to come .|||O O O O O O O O O
The sixth angel blew his trumpet .|||O O O O O O O
Then I heard a voice coming from the horns on the four corners of the golden altar that is before God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet , `` Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These four angels had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The angels were set free to kill a third of all the people on the earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I heard how many troops on horses were in their army .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were 200 , 000 , 000 .|||O O O O O O O O
In my vision , I saw the horses and the riders on the horses .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They looked like this : They had breastplates that were fiery red , dark blue , and yellow like sulfur .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
The horses had fire , smoke , and sulfur coming out of their mouths .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues coming out of the horses ' mouths : the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The horses ' power was in their mouths and also in their tails .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their tails were like snakes that have heads to bite and hurt people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The other people on earth were not killed by these plagues .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But these people still did not change their hearts and turn away from worshiping the things they had made with their own hands .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood -- things that can not see or hear or walk .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They did not change their hearts and turn away from killing other people or from their evil magic , their sexual sins , and their stealing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After this I heard what sounded like a large crowd of people in heaven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !|||O O O O O O O O
Victory , glory , and power belong to our God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
His judgments are true and right .|||O O O O O O O
Our God has punished the prostitute .|||O O O O O O O
She is the one who ruined the earth with her sexual sin .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
God has punished the prostitute to pay her back for the death of his servants . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These people also said , `` Hallelujah !|||O O O O O O O O
She is burning and her smoke will rise forever and ever . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the 24 elders and the four living beings bowed down .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They worshiped God , who sits on the throne .|||O O O O O O O O O O
They said , `` Amen !|||O O O O O O
Hallelujah ! ''|||O O O
Then a voice came from the throne and said , `` Praise our God , all you who serve him !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Praise our God , all you small and great who honor him ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I heard something that sounded like a large crowd of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was as loud as crashing waves or claps of thunder .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people were saying , `` Hallelujah !|||O O O O O O O O
Our Lord God rules .|||O O O O O
He is the All - Powerful .|||O O O O O O O
Let us rejoice and be happy and give God glory !|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Give God glory , because the wedding of the Lamb has come .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And the Lamb 's bride has made herself ready .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Fine linen was given to the bride for her to wear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
The linen was bright and clean . ''|||O O O O O O O O
-LRB- The fine linen means the good things that God 's holy people did . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the angel said to me , `` Write this : Great blessings belong to those who are invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb ! ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then the angel said , `` These are the true words of God . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I bowed down before the angel 's feet to worship him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the angel said to me , `` Do n't worship me !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the truth of Jesus .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So worship God !|||O O O O
Because the truth of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I saw heaven open .|||O O O O O O
There before me was a white horse .|||O O O O O O O O
The rider on the horse was called Faithful and True , because he is right in his judging and in making war .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
His eyes were like burning fire .|||O O O O O O O
He had many crowns on his head .|||O O O O O O O O
A name was written on him , but he was the only one who knew its meaning .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was dressed in a robe dipped in blood , and he was called the Word of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The armies of heaven were following the rider on the white horse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were also riding white horses .|||O O O O O O O
They were dressed in fine linen , white and clean .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
A sharp sword came out of the rider 's mouth , a sword that he would use to defeat the nations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He will crush the grapes in the winepress of the terrible anger of God All - Powerful .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On his robe and on his leg was written this name : king of kings and lord of lords Then I saw an angel standing in the sun .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a loud voice the angel said to all the birds flying in the sky , `` Come together for the great supper of God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Come together so that you can eat the bodies of rulers and army commanders and famous men .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Come to eat the bodies of the horses and their riders and the bodies of all people -- free , slave , small , and great . ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I saw the beast and the rulers of the earth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the beast was captured , and the false prophet was also captured .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was the one who did the miracles for the beast .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its idol .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the birds ate these bodies until they were full .|||O O O O O O O O O O O

I do n't know if you spoke to me before that or when it was that was happening . Or|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

When was it ?|||O O O O
It may have been right after .|||O O O O O O O
Well|||O
My father died right after we talked .|||O O O O O O O O

It 's just , %uh , people get sick ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
and they get sick pretty young ,|||O O O O O O O
and ,|||O O
yeah .|||O O
And you know my sister was n't that old|||O O O O O O O O O

I 'm going to put you on after fifteen minutes .|||O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O

had that happened already ?|||O O O O O
No|||O
No that had not happened , no .|||O O O O O O O O
She passed away in about March or|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O

.|||O
yeah .|||O O
No , she was not doing well .|||O O O O O O O O
She had a brain tumor .|||O O O O O O
And then they operated on|||O O O O O
and things were n't going well ,|||O O O O O O O
and .|||O O
I actually got to see her I guess a day before she died .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
I mean she did n't know that I was there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
if that was you , yeah . yeah , she was just not in|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So it was a blessing , I guess .|||O O O O O O O O O
But , %um .|||O O O O
Anyway , weird stuff .|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
And how about you ?|||O O O O O
Because , I r-|||O O O O
oh I 'm han-|||O O O O
how are your eyes ?|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Well , I do n't know .|||O O O O O O O
I have to go next week you know to see again .|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O
I , %um , not exactly convinced that . It 's okay . You know ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm not sure .|||O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
%uh , it 's been pretty good .|||O O O O O O O O
It was about eighty percent for a while .|||O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O
And then %um , I 'm not exactly sure what it is now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I 'll know in a couple of days .|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
So are you having blurred vision ?|||O O O O O O O
Or|||O
oh yeah , yeah .|||O O O O O
Sure .|||O O
The right eye is %uh , not so great .|||O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
%um , and it got back to about eighty percent .|||O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O
You know it was a detached retina .|||O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
And then they operated on it once ,|||O O O O O O O O
and they operated on it twice .|||O O O O O O O
And , then things seemed to be doing pretty well ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and at the moment I 'm %um , not quite so sure .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
So , who knows . %um .|||O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
But you know it 'll never be more than about seventy or eighty percent . Which is fine .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O
Eighty percent is fantastic .|||B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O
Right .|||O O
Right .|||O O
%um|||O
So we 'll just see . You know|||O O O O O O O O
%hm . we 'll see what happens .|||O O O O O O O O
Frustrating .|||O O
%uh , yeah .|||O O O O
Annoying .|||O O
And that thing that came up recently , , you know I had , oh , a kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
And my right knee ,|||O O O O O
and now it 's my left knee .|||O O O O O O O O
you know , it 's just a pain in the ass .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And yeah . %um , I went to the doctor|||O O O O O O O O O O
and they do a Punktion . Ich weiss nicht wer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Anyway they take , %uh fluid out of it .|||O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
And if it gets irritated take some pills and stuff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And , it 's just a pain in the ass .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So it 's just , l- .|||O O O O O O O
is that like water on the knee ?|||O O O O O O O O
Is that what that is ?|||O O O O O O
%um , well that 's what happens .|||O O O O O O O O
It develops because of irritation , because of a %um , inflammation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
Is that from the running ?|||O O O O O O
And how the inflammation d-|||O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
maybe .|||O O
I mean they do n't know .|||O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
They do n't|||O O O
It just came overnight practically .|||O O O B-TIME O O
Wow .|||O O

and we had a big trip up there and did a lot of walking , a lot of fast walking and stuff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But you know , I mean that mhm . should n't be a big deal . %um|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Was this last crop of **Tuftees** good ?|||O O O O O O O O
So .|||O O
Was your last crop of students from Tufts good ?|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O
How 's that ?|||O O O O
yeah|||O
well they 're still here .|||O O O O O O
Right ,|||O O
but they 're winding down , so you know them really well by this point .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're winding down .|||O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
they 're very good .|||O O O O O
they learned a lot of German .|||O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O
They learned an amazing amount of German .|||O O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O
Before I forget , I saw George Silinas a couple of days ago .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
oh . How 's he doing ?|||O O O O O O O
And he 's had|||O O O O
Well he 's working for an American firm over here ,|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
and he 's doing very very well . %um ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
and his wife just had their fourth child .|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O
Wow .|||O O
A little boy . Benjamin .|||O O O O B-PERSON O
yeah .|||O O
Wow .|||O O
%um , about , %uh , two weeks ago maybe .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O
%huh .|||O O
Tops .|||O O
And I got a card from ,|||O O O O O O O
you remember Amy Gleason ?|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
Well she just had a baby a couple of|||O O O O O O O O O
heard that .|||O O O
Well this is number two .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O
okay .|||O O
I just got a card from Ron and Doris ,|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O
oh .|||O O
and they see Amy Gleason on occasion .|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O
And so I think they told me that .|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Have you heard from Ron and Doris ?|||O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O
Not in a while , no .|||O O O O O O O
They are now living in Rhode Island .|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
You probably knew that .|||O O O O O
Well . yeah .|||O O O O
And she 's teaching at U R I .|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
yeah .|||O O
And it was a very nice letter , because it sounded like she went through very similar things that I did .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know , I went from Chicago to U C S G to here .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O
Right .|||O O
And it 's just such an intellectual letdown .|||O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
And she went from Penn , %um To Columbia . to Columbia to U R I .|||O O O O B-ORG O O O B-ORG O O B-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
Well Columbia 's okay .|||O B-ORG O O O
yeah .|||O O
And she said the students are just ,|||O O O O O O O O
you know , they do n't care ,|||O O O O O O O O
and they 're not very good ,|||O O O O O O O
and all of a sudden she 's getting conference papers rejected|||O O O O O O O O O O O
and she thinks it 's the affiliation .|||O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Because she does n't think the quality of her work has changed .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now I have n't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri %um , you know , affiliation yet .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O
Because the last one I submitted , %um , was in the fall ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I still had my San Diego affiliation .|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O
yeah .|||O O
%um , in fact I 'm still officially on leave .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
If anything came up in the next year we could still go back . uh-huh . %uh you know , for Sam .|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Wow .|||O O
But I think it 's very very very very yeah . unlikely .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
But at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now , she %um has come to terms with this ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O
and yeah . she 's accepted that there 's a lot of good things in Rhode Island .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
And , %um , you know , their life is a lot less complicated ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and she has more time to be a parent .|||O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Good .|||O O
And she 's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ron is working as a financial consultant for , %um , Meryl Lynch .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O
And he|||O O
oh .|||O O
yeah , he had been doing work for some environmental firm , as a consultant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
And , it did n't work out .|||O O O O O O O O
%um He was changing projects every couple of weeks|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
and he said he could n't keep on top of it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
He could n't learn the whole new area %mm . that fast each time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
%um , and he says he went in and had some tests ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Which you know , given how far he 's gotten , you know , he got his degree at Tufts and all , I found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they 're diagnosing this . %um|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
%mm . I wonder about it .|||O O O O O O O
But anyway .|||O O O
yeah ,|||O O
but that 's what he said .|||O O O O O O O
And %um|||O O
yeah .|||O O
He %um|||O O
Whatever 's helpful .|||O O O O
Right .|||O O
So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be happy with that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good .|||O O
And then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time .|||O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O B-DATE O O
uh-huh .|||O O
And they 're doing great .|||O O O O O O
%um , they had just moved to He 's in New York now , right ? a really nice house in Westchester .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
yeah , Good . an older home that you know Julie is of course carving up and making beautiful . %um|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to New York ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
and that did n't work out .|||O O O O O O O
She said they had her doing things that she really was n't qualified to do %ah . and that she really did n't feel competent doing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And , they mutually agreed that she should leave .|||O O O O O O O O O O
And so she was looking for another job .|||O O O O O O O O O
And , %um , I 'm sure she 'll find one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
She 's so talented .|||O O O O O
She may have found one by now . %um|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
oh yeah .|||O O O
Amazing ,|||O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah ,|||O O
and so we met , %um , %uh Adrian , their kid , who was three uh-huh . and just a really lovely little boy .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O

yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
And %uh Ron and Doris sent us a picture of theirs|||O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O
and he has Ron 's expressions .|||O O O B-PERSON O O O
He really looks like Ron .|||O O O O B-PERSON O
oh that 's life .|||O O O O O
%um , and he looked really big too .|||O O O O O O O O O
In this picture , he 's three and a half .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
yeah .|||O O
%huh .|||O O
%um , but Leo and Julie just seemed , %um sort of happy with the decisions they 've made .|||O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And|||O
Good .|||O O
%um , like every|||O O O O
now is he with a publishing house now ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Which one is he with .|||O O O O O O
Yes which one %um|||O O O O
Well I can|||O O O
yeah|||O
It 's one of these sort of universi- the public university book stuff .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It might be Hard Core Brace .|||O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
I 'm not sure .|||O O O O O
oh yeah .|||O O O
I have two friends in publishing .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
It may be the other one that just took the job with Hard Core Brace|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG
I do n't remember which one .|||O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Anyway , he 's enjoying it and liking it|||O O O O O O O O O
and they 're doing okay .|||O O O O O O
yeah|||O
he seems to feel really like he 's doing the right thing|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and he is Great still in academic publishing .|||O O O O O O O O O
My other friend just moved to trade publishing after years in academic publishing|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O
and mhm %um you know . It feels like maybe she made a compromise|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it 's like three times the money as with everything else|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O
so|||O
wow wow|||O O
industry and academics %um|||O O O O
Terrible|||O
yeah it 's amazing|||O O O O
and %um You know ages ago I got a card from Liz Gana .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
I told you this .|||O O O O O
because %uh you showed us her picture .|||O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
yeah|||O
Crazy|||O
%um and I keep thinking maybe I 'd get in touch|||O O O O O O O O O O O
but I have n't done it .|||O O O O O O O
and then I saw in the %um Tufts thing that Ginny Totta you know in the alumni thing is living in the|||O O O O O O O B-ORG O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
So , anyway , how are you doing these days ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Things are going very well .|||O O O O O O
I think I had mentioned before %uh , that there 's a company now that I 'm working with %um , %uh , which is very much just myself and Guss .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
oh .|||O O
And that %um|||O O O
No , you had n't mentioned that .|||O O O O O O O O
%eh , oh , okay .|||O O O O O O
okay , so %um|||O O O O
%eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and you were entertaining offers .|||O O O O O O
And , %uh|||O O O
well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to just kind of set up my own company , of sorts .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um oh . So things are going extremely well .|||O O O O O O O O O O
So , I had one client who said that he 'd pay me a minimum amount .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You know , he , %uh ,|||O O O O O O O
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week for the next two three years . mhm . Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O
so I decided that it would make sense to do this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um and , %um , I 've been getting substantially more work than then .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
So I 'm quite pleased .|||O O O O O O
Well that 's good .|||O O O O O
%um , so I have a bunch of %uh work that I need to do on my flat this year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
I 've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , %uh , it should come out this year .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
oh , well that 's good .|||O O O O O O O
It should be done in a few months .|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
oh , yeah|||O O O
I remember So you talking a little bit about it at one point .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
yeah .|||O O
So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um . I do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um , actually right at the moment finances are not going real well .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But %ah well . I am working on that one .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
%uh .|||O O
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , the main reason for that is I had not really anticipated a few expenses that recently came up %ah . %uh , related to a couple of burglaries that I had .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , harsh . Harsh .|||O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah ,|||O O
and .|||O O
Not a whole lot I can do about that now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Indeed . Indeed .|||O O O O
have to deal with the situation .|||O O O O O O O
And|||O
So that 's what I 'm doing .|||O O O O O O O O
Sounds good .|||O O O
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that I 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent has been work .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've actually been doing a lot of it .|||O O O O O O O O O O
oh wow .|||O O O
And %uh , I turned in my Master 's thesis back in May ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
and I 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
actually it turns out that one thing , one little bit in what I was doing , %uh , is going to turn out to be very important in the end . %uh , from what I had been reading in the literature .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You see the one very annoying thing about all of this , was my advisor has been in France for a year and a half .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
yeah .|||O O
And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know there was n't much discussion .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yup ,|||O O
yup .|||O O
But , %um Anyway , I had been kind of telling him that , you know , from my reading of the literature , I thought that this one little alteration I had made in my model was kind of clever and unique .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
And it made the one type of solution occur , which was seen experimentally ,|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O
but none of the other models %uh , had ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
the- ,|||O O
I 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
And one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
Yes .|||O O
okay .|||O O
if you separate out the different modes of the laser mhm . and look at one of those , you get more than one frequency .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O
okay .|||O O
So what 's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And %uh With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you ca n't find that frequency in a driven , %uh , frequency .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You ca n't find so that it will sustain .|||O O O O O O O O O O
okay .|||O O
Yes .|||O O
So yeah , that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And so you should n't actually really be able to ever see it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment you see it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Got it ,|||O O O
got it .|||O O O
I see .|||O O O
So , %um , I found a simple modification of the original formula , which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But yeah . it gives a driving term .|||O O O O O O O O O
oh , okay .|||O O O O
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer , you just ca n't always write it down very easily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exactly .|||O O
oh wow .|||O O O
so you 're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser , %uh , whatever it is science .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But|||O
which , %um , is kind of interesting considering that that 's not really my thing . . Indeed . Indeed . being an experimentalist , not a theorist .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But|||O O O O O O O O O O O
so are you going to get an article in Nature or something ?|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O
%um , actually , I 'm not sure if we 're shooting for op- ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think Optics Letters is probably the one that we 're shooting for , or else , perhaps , though I do n't think it 's quite that significant , would be Phys Rev Letters .|||O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
%hm .|||O O
But , %uh , we want to write a letter , and then a couple articles .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O
yeah .|||O O
%hm . impressive .|||O O O O
And I do n't know how much you know about scientific literature ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but letters are much more prestigious than , articles .|||O O O O O O O O O O
oh , okay .|||O O O O
oh , I did n't realize that .|||O O O O O O O O
okay .|||O O
yeah ,|||O O
so that 's why it 's actually a big deal is|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean , you know , writing a couple of articles based on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and yeah . %uh , it 's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And what 's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that I thought that this was kind of significant .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the thesis down that You know , people see the anti phased motion ,|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it 's true|||O O O O
they do in the transients|||O O O O O
And I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature has this frequency in the transients Yes . %eh and not driven .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And , %uh , what happened was after I had turned in my thesis but before I saw Neil again , he went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work , was , that their models could n't show this as a driven frequency ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yet their experiments showed it as a driven frequency .|||O O O O O O O O O O
oh cool .|||O O O
and so Neil then -- Said oh just a second I -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-TIME O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O B-ORG I-ORG
and he said , hey Lowell , we got to write this up .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Exactly .|||O O
And I was like , well I 've been telling you that Neil .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
Indeed .|||O O
So Cool . Cool . that 's mostly the sort of stuff that I 'm spending a lot of time on now . %um|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well it 'll look good on your C V , your resume .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you might as well spend the time .|||O O O O O O O O O
Yes , well ,|||O O O O
%uh , no , it 's definitely worth doing . %um ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I would have been spending more time on it if it were n't for %uh dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that I 've been dealing with .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes .|||O O
yeah , okay .|||O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I mean the thing that i-|||O O O O O O
this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that was easy ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was just that no one really knew it was worth breaking into .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exactly .|||O O
Exactly .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
And so the problem is that now they found out that it 's worth breaking into .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
And unfortunately .|||O O O
Well , it 's kind of odd .|||O O O O O O O O
They 've stolen very weird things for the most part .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
as far|||O O
yeah|||O
as a .|||O O O
The first time they broke in , what they stole was just bizarre ,|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
mostly worthless stuff .|||O O O O
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre-amplifier of my stereo . Unfortunately , because it 's a nice pre-amplifier ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it has an off board power supply which they did n't steal , which makes the thing that they **stoled** absolutely worthless .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%huh .|||O O
So .|||O O
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .|||O O O O O O
so when they broke in the second time did they steal the %uh offboard amplifier ?|||O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Actually , no ,|||O O O O
all they stole the second time was my bike .|||O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O
%huh .|||O O
Which was actually where the major problem came . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that I suddenly had no transportation .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And so , I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and %mm . that cost me a lot of time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Exactly .|||O O
Because ,|||O O
yes|||O
Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting one purchased , and then having to , you know , go get it and things like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , that 's dealt with at least .|||O O O O O O O O O
And so %uh , that 's yeah at least dealt with .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But yeah . yeah .|||O O O O O
At least Well that would make sense during the summer %uh according to the stipulations of my fellowship , I can actually earn money during the summer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
But %um , guessed what happened .|||O O O O O O O
What ?|||O O
%um The %um|||O O O
Again ?|||O O
%um 118.91_120.82_B: Let 's see ,|||O O O O O O
two weeks ago|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
I know Sue is going to Rhode Island .|||O O B-PERSON O O O B-GPE I-GPE O
%eh Right .|||O O O
Right .|||O O
Did she see her mom ?|||O O O O O O
Yes she did .|||O O O O
And ?|||O O
Yes she did .|||O O O O
And ?|||O O
%um , %um , which we had already anticipated that it was going to happen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I spoke to her mom on Thursday|||O O O O O O B-DATE
%um and I asked her|||O O O O O
I said listen|||O O O
I said %um please come to Shabbat|||O O O O O O O
things have come to a point where I may have to relinquish my , %uh parenting .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%uh would you mind %uh taking her back|||O O O O O O O O
and she said no .|||O O O O O
She said %uh she 'd be more than happy to .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Really ?|||O O
This girl has everything in her dreams you know .|||O O O O O O O O O O
it is as my husband says %uh , %uh al kadir the destiny .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Selema I 'm telling you ,|||B-PERSON O O O O O
it is like Allah has just painted the road|||O O O O O O O O O
and all I had to do was get on it and follow it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean things have been happening that has just scared the heck out of me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I told mom|||O O O
I said mom it is when you believe in Allah , when you have faith and know when you truly give your heart to Allah , only Allah can make the way clear for you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%uh .|||O O
I believe that by her birthday she will be living with her mother .|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O
Really ?|||O O
mhm mhm .|||O O O
and is she seem like she 's together enough ?|||O O O O O O O O O O
she 's in a two year program .|||O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O
She 's in the program now .|||O O O O O O O
She 's doing very well .|||O O O O O O
When I talked to her I 'm talking to her like I 'm talking to you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wrote her a letter and told her|||O O O O O O O O
I said I feel like I know you even though I never met you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They seemed surprised that ,|||O O O O O
I mean most women you lose your baby that 's it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
But almighty God is|||O O O O
You never even get a chance to see them again .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's true .|||O O O O
That 's true .|||O O O O
But that 's what she had wrote me .|||O O O O O O O O O
she said it is just awesome to her what is happening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yup .|||O O
mhm .|||O O
aw I 've heard of that .|||O O O O O O O
yup .|||O O
So Francis|||O B-PERSON
Did she say how she felt about what had happened ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
No .|||O O
we have n't really talked about that|||O O O O O O O
but I 'm planning on making a trip down to visit her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , how does Akina feel ?|||O O O O B-PERSON O O
she 's , very happy about it .|||O O O O O O O O
Very ha-|||O O
Well did she come home and say I saw her , I look like her or what ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we talked on the phone|||O O O O O
and you know she talked about %um her sisters you know and things|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 've spent the night with her sisters and things|||O O O O B-TIME O O O O O
and %um it 's just been quite interesting although when she was in Rhode Island she was very disruptive , %um down there and really caused Francis a lot of stress|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
and %um Francis was very worried about me because she came home two weeks before you know %um because she just was acting like a total nigger child .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-oh !|||O O
Hope the research did n't hear that !|||O O O O O O O O
uh-oh !|||O O
wait|||O
wait|||O
Alita I 'm telling you nobody can handle her but you , okay .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And %um ,|||O O O
but she was very concerned about me and everything %um because %um the child had told some lies about me and about you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
oh 296.72_297.91_A: oh no .|||O O O O O
And about|||O O
oh yeah mhm|||O O O
oh goodness .|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
That we were abusing ,|||O O O O O
that %um you know ,|||O O O O O
oh yeah|||O O
she did some %eh ,|||O O O O O
and it was very , very bad .|||O O O O O O O O
My daughter - in - law Barbara got on her case real serious yesterday .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-DATE O
Told her that she could n't talk to Jasmine play with Jasmine because she said she hurt Jasmine 's Jetta you know|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O
and she said that if it was n't for Jetta you know Jasmine 's daddy would n't be|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O
oh she 'd|||O O O
oh man %uh it was|||O O O O O
aw .|||O O
You know that has always been very scary to me even after .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I said to Mark oh my god . What 's she going to say|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
because I knew what she would do if I took her somewhere you know what she would say|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I ,|||O O O
you know in the climate of today , Yes . people saying something like that .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That well ,|||O O O
you know that 's|||O O O O
and Francis was very concerned in reference to you know she was in school and things|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and she was very , very concerned .|||O O O O O O O O
Alita she said this little girl has a serious problem .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
She wrote me a letter mhm . you know about her needing a lot of love , a lot of %um help and different things like this ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you know you 've heard the saying I 'm sure from your grandmother|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sins of your parents will be waged back at you , %hm . you know ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%um and again my husband said we were going to give it a month , you know and said he was even going to have to sheik pray over her , you know for the jen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
You know , I mean , we 're d- , you know ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I think we 're still going to be doing that|||O O O O O O O O O O O

But I still need to go more often .|||O O O O O O O O O
Well how often are you going ?|||O O O O O O O
Only four days a week .|||O O O O O O
.|||O
yeah .|||O O
Got to get that up to five .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
%mm .|||O O
But , I do n't really like going with Anne Marie because she does n't like to stay very long .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
Why ?|||O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
She kind of ,|||O O O O
well unfortunately for some reason she 's not like into cardio vascular .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So when I 'm still riding the bike she 's completely finished her weight lifting routine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
And like I have n't even started mine . mhm . You know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular . mhm . It 's true . And that lifting the weights wo n't lose weight .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm %mm .|||O O O
You wo n't lose it , you know ,|||O O O O O O O O O
but|||O
No|||O
I mean you might lose some|||O O O O O O
but that 's only when yo- .|||O O O O O O O
For a woman who is lifting not that much I do n't think yeah . You would .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I mean yeah|||O O O
I mean the only thing is %um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah ,|||O O
So I do n't know|||O O O O O
maybe she 'll catch on soon .|||O O O O O O O
You do burn a lot of calories an hour though , lifting weights .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
But %uh|||O O
yeah|||O
I mean I do n't think you 're going to lose that much .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and also lifting weights at Bally 's means you 're standing on line for as much time as you 're actually lifting .|||O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Really .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
That 's too bad .|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
So is it really overcrowded ?|||O O O O O O
Well , I mean obviously since I work I ca n't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
mhm .|||O O
But I 'm sure for people who go in the daytime it 's probably dead . yeah . You know|||O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O
and %um , like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings it 's totally dead .|||O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
So|||O
But you know the weeknights is pretty crazy .|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah|||O
I found a gym yesterday here that 's only eight pounds a month which is like twelve dollars , twelve fifty|||O O O O B-DATE O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL

So uh-huh . I think %um tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up .|||O O O O O O B-TIME B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Even Charlie 's going to join ?|||O B-PERSON O O O O O

but it has to be debited from a bank account so it 's got to be debited from his .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
In your letter you said that he eats constantly .|||O O O O O O O O O O
oh my god .|||O O O O
Really ?|||O O
Alice , I 've never seen anybody eat as much as he does|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
and he 's so skinny .|||O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
I mean the amount of cereal he eats like between meals and after meals|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
and we go through a box of cereal every two days .|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
Really ?|||O O
yeah .|||O O
Wow .|||O O
He eats at least like four of cereal a day like in addition to like meals .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
And when he goes to work he brings four sandwiches with him , uh-huh . a bag of potato chips uh-huh . %um you know and then little sweetie things chocolates and **cakies** and stuff like that .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
uh-huh|||O
And then you know before he leaves every morning he has like two fried eggs mhm on toast with cheese %um vegetarian sausages %um and like fruit|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and oh my god it 's just crazy .|||O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
It 's crazy how much he eats .|||O O O O O O O O
He was probably starving when he was here .|||O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I think what we got to do is just when he comes just have lots of cereal .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He likes Cocoa Pops .|||O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT O
oh boy .|||O O O
Wow .|||O O
That 's pretty crazy .|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
It 's all about being a blue collar man .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I guess so .|||O O O O
They 're the ones who can eat all day .|||O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
Really ?|||O O
Well I mean he does work his ass off|||O O O O O O O O O
so|||O
yeah .|||O O
But %uh 291.01_291.28_B: %hm .|||O O O O O
%hm .|||O O
So , I assume it 's hard for you not to eat as much as he does .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No .|||O O
I learned quick fast in a hurry because I 've gained so much weight .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

yeah .|||O O
Actually in the first week I was here -- mhm . -- I gained a lot|||O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
so .|||O O
Well it 's hard to you know not eat when somebody else is eating .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I 'm figuring it out fast because -- okay -- with not working out and all yeah . it 's pretty miserable my crunch tape .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
So I called this woman today|||O O O O O B-DATE

What ?|||O O
How hideous they were .|||O O O O O
Adele was n't at Lisa Manachi 's .|||B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O
Adele went to the mass wedding .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O

Really ?|||O O
Well I said I would not feel comfortable going .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I was not invited . mhm . You know|||O O O O O O O O O
and mom and dad were like well you know a wedding that 's a mass is open to everyone .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was like well that 's fine|||O O O O O O O
but I would not feel comfortable going .|||O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
I think that would be obnoxious|||O O O O O O
and I think they would then feel guilty for not inviting me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Right .|||O O
To -- -- you know the other thing , the reception .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
I just would n't go .|||O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
So they had to take it down and drive her home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
So they 're always kind of pissy at me .|||O O O O O O O O O O
%mm . That 's okay .|||O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
I mean I 've been thinking about it|||O O O O O O O O
and the black 's not going to be so hot you know|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
but|||O
mhm .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
Apparently they were also carrying lillies which is kind of goofy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Well I guess she did that because someone suggested that to her because you know the lillies the symbol of the virgin Mary .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O
mhm .|||O O
White lillies ?|||O O O
White lillies and black dresses .|||O O O O O O

Adele was carrying on that she thought she was at a funeral|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O

%mm .|||O O
So now you think my wedding 's going to be pretty tasteful right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But|||O
oh yeah .|||O O O
Now what about the matchbooks ?|||O O O O O O
Well I 'll work on it .|||O O O O O O O

I have n't forgotten those|||O O O O O
and they 'll still be enough time when I come home for me to order those .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I 'll have remind him of that little -- -- item .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
%huh how fun- .|||O O O O
You know I was talking to my friend Heather from Wisconsin the other day --|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-GPE O O O O

And at her sister 's wedding %uh , they provided champagne and beer .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if you wanted any other kind of drink you had to pay for it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
that 's actually kind of common|||O O O O O O
but -- oh it is . it 's pretty de classe .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I kind of thou- ,|||O O O O O O
I mean of course I did n't say anything to her .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
You know I said as far as I knew we were n't charging people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Now|||O
But %uh ,|||O O O
yeah|||O
Dad and I went to buy the wine the other day .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
And there were having a sale on the wine dad wanted .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
Are you talking to me ?|||O O O O O O
Of course I 'm talking to you .|||O O O O O O O O
I can hardly hear you .|||O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
I thought you were talking to somebody else and like put the phone down or something .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm talking to you .|||O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
No dad told me that .|||O O O O O O
oh he did tell you .|||O O O O O O
It 's all Chilean .|||O O O B-NORP O
yeah .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
Walnut Crest or Walnut Creek or -- %mm . -- something like that .|||B-ORG I-ORG O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know .|||O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
There 's a pretty good sale . %mm . So now we have to keep our eyes open for a champagne sale .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An- ,|||O O
do you know if Jack called Spencer yet ?|||O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O
I told him this morning to do it this week .|||O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
And he just keeps forgetting .|||O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
But o-|||O O
How 's he doing ?|||O O O O O
Much better .|||O O O
yeah ?|||O O
yeah .|||O O
he 's often chipper .|||O O O O O
He went for a walk this morning at five seventeen .|||O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
Pe-|||O
oh my god .|||O O O O
Is that because he 's not sleeping and|||O O O O O O O O
Well because he could n't breathe because all the cats were in the bedroom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh .|||O O
So I think it 's time to give all the cats a bath .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
%mm .|||O O
yeah|||O
and the- ,|||O O O
you should do that .|||O O O O O
I know .|||O O O
It 's a two person job though .|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
I 'll have to get somebody to help me .|||O O O O O O O O O O
%mm . yeah .|||O O O O
%hm .|||O O
But %uh , yeah ,|||O O O O O
it 's still a fairly expensive call|||O O O O O O O
%uh but it 's a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we actually make my parents in law pay it ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
then it|||O O
the Dutch have such high taxes on those|||O B-NORP O O O O O O
they consider it a luxury to call around the world|||O O O O O O O O O O
so they tax it really high .|||O O O O O O O
Anyway %um|||O O
So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth|||O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE
and you 're going to go to %uh Amsterdam .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
Well I would say is once you 're at a hotel uh-huh %um , why do n't you call me at work and let me know where you are ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then we can make arrangements that day %um , that I can meet you in Amsterdam .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
And maybe I 'll come by , public transport .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It 's probably easier for me to come by public transport in Amsterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
mhm .|||O O
The streets are small|||O O O O
and there 's no parking .|||O O O O O O
So I probably will come by public transport|||O O O O O O O O
but I do n't know .|||O O O O O O
We 'll see where you 're staying|||O O O O O O O
%um|||O
and there 's a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see stuff in Amsterdam|||O O O O O B-GPE
and %uh since the days are really long ,|||O O O O O O O O O
I mean it stays light here till about ten thirty eleven o'clock mhm . at night .|||O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME B-TIME I-TIME O O B-TIME I-TIME O
So if you want we can take a ride and go see stuff at night|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME
and I can take you to some places ,|||O O O O O O O O O
we can %uh go see some stuff .|||O O O O O O O O
%um , depends on what you guys want to see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
So you guys should pick out the things you want to see and let me know .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay|||O
%um and I 'll sit and talk with Anya about some things that maybe we think that it would be neat for you to see .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So if you do n't have any ideas we 'll just put something together for you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay .|||O O
%um but yeah|||O O O
but I can pick you up th- ,|||O O O O O O O O
you know I 'll probably be there some time around six|||O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME
and we can like do a quick dinner or something yeah and go see whatever you want to see ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want to stay in Amsterdam that 's fine .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
If you want to go %uh off into the countryside somewhere and see a little bit of , echte Holland , real Holland and we can do that too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Actually I 've been up to Holland before .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O
Spent about two weeks up there .|||O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O
yeah .|||O O
So %um ,|||O O O
but that was years and years ago .|||O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
With your parents when your father was stationed over here , right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
But we got to see Den Haag and places like that too which we 're obviously not going to see this time .|||O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But %um|||O O
has Kim been here before ?|||O B-PERSON O O O O
And , an-|||O O O
No .|||O O
oh good .|||O O O
But then again I 'm not sure that Kim would be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff . those military things .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Would you be interested in seeing Shape Headquarters again .|||O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC O O
No . Not really .|||O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I did n't think so .|||O O O O O O
Somehow I had this feeling that the military taste had been beaten out of you .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yep .|||O O
I 'm ,|||O O O
the mil- ,|||O O O
I ca n't say too bad things about the military though .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
They still have my goods|||O O O O O
and they 'll probably hold them hostage .|||O O O O O O O O
And they own my body and soul for like another four years|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
so I just got to pray that they|||O O O O O O O O
oh do they ?|||O O O O
yeah .|||O O
I owe four years in active reserve time .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
aw great .|||O O O
Do they do that to everyone ?|||O O O O O O O
Milo , get out of there|||O O O O O O
yeah -- -- %eh everyone %uh who has n't been like you were|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you went through like the thirty six two process .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL O O
mhm .|||O O
So you do n't have it|||O O O O O O
but yeah if you just separate normally and you have n't served at least eight years , then you owe it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O
And that 's one of those things they just never tell you up front .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No .|||O O
They never said anything|||O O O O
I figured there was something like that because|||O O O O O O O O
And I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in college too .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So .|||O O
yeah .|||O O
I mean that 's the military .|||O O O O O O O
I have my discharge papers and everything|||O O O O O O O
uh-huh .|||O O
and I 've said that yeah I will give a urine sample or a blood sample if they call me back for those , but they 're going to have to pay my trip back to the states . because there 's no bases in Holland and I 'm not going to pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O
If they want me they can pay ,|||O O O O O O O O
bring me back active duty and pay me for the day if they 're going to drag me off somewhere .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But %uh , first they have to find me .|||O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
yeah , that 's the other|||O O O O O O
it was i- ,|||O O O O
if you 're in another country I mean and you 're not planning on coming back to the U S what are they going to do even if you do n't .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Well I mean I 'm still American citizen|||O O O O O O B-NORP O
and I still would like to be welcome in my own country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although g-|||O O
%uh I mean if they denied my citizenship and I became a citizen here I probably would n't be a horror either ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but %uh yeah|||O O O
right now I mean I do want to keep my American citizenship|||O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O
so .|||O O
I kind of want to|||O O O O O
Are you going to become a dual citizen ?|||O O O O O O O O O
What 's that ?|||O O O O
Are you going to try and become a dual citizen ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Have dual citizenship ?|||O O O O
You ca n't do that ,|||O O O O O O
%um , the only way to be a dual citizen is if you 're born in a foreign country|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like if I were born in Holland and then had American parents . Then I could be a dual citizen .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O
But you ca n't|||O O O O
If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would automatically lose my American citizenship .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-NORP O O
As far as the Americans are concerned , yeah .|||O O O O B-NORP O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
The Dutch could care less .|||O B-NORP O O O O
The Dutch would say fine|||O B-NORP O O O
want to be a dual citizen ,|||O O O O O O O
that 's fine ,|||O O O O
but the Americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that act of asking for it takes away your American citizenship .|||O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
I mean it 's kind of stupid .|||O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
So I 'm an expatriot .|||O O O O O O
An American expatriot .|||O B-NORP O O
An American living abroad .|||O B-NORP O O O
I still have to file a tax return .|||O O O O O O O O O
Do you ?|||O O O
yeah .|||O O
But my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free .|||O O B-ORDINAL B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O
Good grief .|||O O O
As long as I do n't bring it back to the states .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good grief .|||O O O
I R S for you , %huh ?|||B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
oh they want their share .|||O O O O O O
They want their piece of meat .|||O O O O O O O
But all foreign taxes are deductible ,|||O O O O O O O
and my taxes here are fifty percent of income .|||O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O
So the taxes here are so much higher that , yeah I would never have to worry about it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unless you became C E O of the company then maybe like a thousand dollars would be taxable , right ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
Somehow it raises a small amount .|||O O O O O O O
the problem 's going to %uh be Anya 's American salary is taxable here and at fifty percent|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-NORP O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT
so we 're going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary .|||O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O
aw .|||O O
Some amount that has to be deducted a certain amount|||O O O O O O O O O O
and the amount we pay the American government is deductible ,|||O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O
but we 'll still owe some taxes .|||O O O O O O O O
Th- ,|||O O
see I do n't know how it works .|||O O O O O O O O O
we 're going to be in need of some sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue how that all works .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They do n't have the Quicken Dutch version ?|||O O O O O B-PRODUCT B-LANGUAGE O O
yeah .|||O O
%ah , you know I would n't trust it because it 's so complicated with this international garbage or else the Turbo Tax with the Dutch modules . that I just would n't trust it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT I-PRODUCT O O B-LANGUAGE O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know , %eh .|||O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
So complicated when you 're dealing with a Dutch tax form .|||O O O O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O O O
Anya had to read it|||B-PERSON O O O O
and Anya and her father did n't understand the damn thing .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
How am I supposed to understand it ?|||O O O O O O O O
I 'm really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with ,|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
Oregon you pay state tax|||B-GPE O O O O
Washington you do n't .|||B-GPE O O O O
I 'm looking forward to that cause %uh|||O O O O O O O O
yeah|||O
but You 'll be a student|||O O O O O O
so you ,|||O O O
I mean you 're|||O O O O
what is your income ?|||O O O O O
oh , well|||O O O
See I think y- , %um ,|||O O O O O O O
it 'll probably be about five thousand dollars the portion of this year that I 'm in Oregon|||O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O B-GPE
and then next year it 'll be eleven thousand .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
yeah .|||O O
But I mean you 're below the poverty line at that level .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yeah .|||O O
So I mean any income that y-|||O O O O O O O
Well|||O
But then I 've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in Washington|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O B-GPE
but|||O
That should be non taxable out of state income .|||O O O O O O O O O O
It should|||O O
but you know it 's not going to be a fun tax return year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O
I had that when I went into the military .|||O O O O O O O O O O
But then again .|||O O O O
I had Kans- ,|||O O O O
I had to file three taxes .|||O O O O B-CARDINAL O O
I had to file Georgia , Kansas yeah and then my federal .|||O O O O B-GPE O B-GPE O O O O O O
So .|||O O
Well , %um actually I think this phone call 's just about to end cause it 's only half an hour ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
but %um|||O O
So let 's see .|||O O O O O
I 'll give you a call when we arrive in h- ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
or maybe I 'll just call you when we get in Holland just to let you know we 're there ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
so if we get in the eighteenth or the nineteenth and then call you back %um when we get to a hotel or something like that .|||O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay that 's a great idea .|||O O O O O O O
as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled you can call me|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
and %uh if it 's at night , just call Anya 's parents|||O O O O O O B-TIME O O O B-PERSON O O
okay so|||O O
and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O B-CARDINAL
so like right now okay it 's one eight one zero area code .|||O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL O O O
If you dial in Holland , it 's zero one eight one zero . okay in Holland|||O O O O B-GPE O O O B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL B-CARDINAL O O O B-GPE
and then yeah you can just call up|||O O O O O O O O
if it 's during the work hours , fine , call me at work .|||O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O
If not , call Anya 's parents if you do n't have a new phone number for me .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if you do , I 'll send it by email okay if I get it before this weekend|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE
we 'll email you something|||O O O O O
but if you do n't get email then just call Anya 's parents|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O
If we have a phone by then , they 'll be able to give you the number|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
okay|||O
and just remember to ask for her mother .|||O O O O O O O O O
and it 's Goode , right|||O O O B-PERSON O O
Bode|||B-PERSON
Bode|||B-PERSON
Bode as in abode|||B-PERSON O O O
abode|||O
minus the A|||O O O

%uh %ah %uh It 's Mifrau|||O O O O O O
is|||O
it 's Frau in German|||O O O O B-LANGUAGE
it 's Frau|||O O O
mhm|||O
and then Dutch it 's Mifrau|||O O B-LANGUAGE O O O
I 'll probably never remember that|||O O O O O O
so hope they wo n't be offended .|||O O O O O O O O
nah do n't worry about it .|||O O O O O O O
You can just call her Missus|||O O O O O O
you can just call her Missus and speak English to her .|||O O O O O O O O B-LANGUAGE O O O
she understands|||O O
just talk slowly and clearly .|||O O O O O O
okay|||O
and once you 're in Holland the line will be really clear .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
I mean the phones here are pretty good . once you 're in the country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's just these to America|||O O O O O B-GPE
it 's always kind of iffy|||O O O O O O

Minutes of the dialogue between Saddam and Rumsfeld from trusted American sources .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O B-NORP O O
What follows is the text of the minutes|||O O O O O O O O
At the start of the conversation President Saddam appeared extremely calm .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
Perhaps he was surprised that his guest was Rumsfeld , but he did not appear at all nervously tense .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O
Rumsfeld began the conversation by saying Rumsfeld : I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in Iraq ; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside Iraq , they have advised us to listen to you .|||B-PERSON O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
Saddam Hussein : So what do you want ?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O
Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud Iraq , you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have assaulted the sovereignty of an independent free sovereign country ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have committed crimes which history will record against you as evidence of your blood - stained civilization .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So what do you want after all that ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Rumsfeld -LRB- trying to suppress his anger -RRB- : What 's past is past , I came especially to make you a clear and specific offer and I want to hear from you a clear and definite answer .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Saddam Hussein -LRB- mockingly -RRB- : I thought you had come to apologize and restore power to the Iraqis .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O
Rumsfeld : We have nothing to apologize for , you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
Saddam Hussein : I know that you are ignorant of history , and I know that your president is no less ignorant but it seems that you have continued to lie to the extent that you now believe yourselves .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If " by our neighbors " you mean the Zionist Entity then we did indeed form a danger , we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in Palestine .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE I-GPE I-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O
This is the wish of every Arab person and not just every Iraqi .|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O B-NORP O
For this is Arab land and its people are Arab , and the Zionists are the ones who occupied the land and came to us from all over the world with your help , yours , and that of the old imperial powers .|||O O O B-NORP O O O O O B-NORP O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if you meant Kuwait , I want to ask you .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O
Did you withdraw from Kuwait or not ?|||O O O O B-GPE O O O
Rumsfeld : These are security issues .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O
Besides , there are security agreements between us and Kuwait and the other Gulf states ... we came at their request to protect them from your threats .|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Saddam Hussein : Is n't funny that the wolf is being entrusted with the sheep ?|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people of Kuwait are an Arab people .|||O O O B-GPE O O B-NORP O O
And Kuwait is Iraqi territory , therefore I ask you to read history carefully , although I am certain that you wo n't comprehend it .|||O B-GPE O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We asked Jalal Talabani to make a statement in which he denies any intention to execute you as a sign of good will from us .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Saddam 's last days and what is said he was like|||B-PERSON O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O
Bu Thari|||B-PERSON I-PERSON
What we know about Saddam Hussein in recent years is that he had changed a lot .|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O
He had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned , saying that Saddam supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .|||O O B-NORP O O O O O B-NORP O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O
He had many works .|||O O O O O
But some explained his Islamic tendency by saying that he was currying favor with the Sunnis as if they were reading his mind .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
I have followed Saddam Hussein , especially in recent years , and I noticed about him was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And his punishment was unjust .|||O O O O O O
I mean , for example , the dancer would be killed after second offence .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O
I did not expect anyone to kill the dancer unless good would come of it , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another example - after his son Udai harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , Saddam ordered him to be killed .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
And in fact he was fired on but survived miraculously , after being hit with several fatal shots some of which hit his spine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a sign that there was good in him otherwise he would not have ordered the killing of his son , his own child .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But he was not a scholar nor feared in God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I myself heard from some people who were in Iraq about the things that Saddam Hussein used to do , and could not be reasonably done by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of his actions that they were only to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O
But we judge by the appearances and his end was in line with the appearance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In his last days during the fall of Baghdad and his disappearance , an old woman or man said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that he was hiding in her house and had had his prayer mat with him and was always praying and reading the Koran .|||O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O
Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?|||O O O O O O O O O
Bear in mind that many have said that Saddam prayed regularly especially after he was put in prison by the Rafida and their masters .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
Some of those who said that he was always praying and reading the Koran are the Christians who visited him in his prison cell .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
Finally , during his hanging , the Rafida tried to distract him and keep him from saying the Creed before his death .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were trying everything they could but we say that God made him steadfast for the whole world to see that he died acknowledging God .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Rafida were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that he would lose control and curse them , then they would have killed him .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So they could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from Saddam and cut the rest .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
However he remained steadfast in saying the creed and was killed whilst saying it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Islam Diary : A leader of the Shiite death squads in Sadr City , east of Baghdad , acknowledged that the Mahdi Army militia was involved in killing operations of Arab Sunni men after kidnapping them , despite their relatives having paid the blood money demanded by the hostage - takers in return for their being freed .|||B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O B-NORP O O O B-GPE I-GPE O O O B-GPE O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O B-NORP B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Speaking at the same time about an Iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the Sunnis . " Fadil " , a commander in the Mahdi Army tells how he had followed three Arab Sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the Karada bridge , after having informed an Iraqi army road block close to the area that he was pursuing " terrorists " , then attacked the car of the group in question .|||O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O B-PERSON O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O B-CARDINAL B-NORP B-NORP O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O B-FAC I-FAC I-FAC O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Eliminate the personal income tax -LRB- Reproduced from Yueguang blog -RRB- .|||O O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O
Dift Wu|||B-PERSON I-PERSON
Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for the country amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % came from the working class , and only 10 % came from the wealthy .|||O O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O
Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on improving the quality of life of wage earners .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on " taking from the rich to help the poor , " neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If this tax continues to be collected , it will be working against the original intention behind the income tax .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clearly the necessity for the personal income tax needs to be challenged .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I propose eliminating the personal income tax just as the agricultural tax was eliminated , to give people an opportunity to prosper .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If we think in terms of humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by letting poor people get rich , we should give low - and moderate - income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives ; the threshold for China 's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O
That would take it to a minimally humanized level , and then we could really talk about " people first . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O
With a threshold below this level , the poor will always be poor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yesterday CCTV presented a program on adjustment of the personal income tax , emphasized that the main goal of the adjustment was to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .|||O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If we really want to give poor people a chance to get wealthy , the threshold for the personal income tax should be tripled .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With anything under this threshold , the poor will have no chance to get rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if we 're looking at it in terms of " taking from the rich , " the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China 's social national income , namely how to eliminate the " unreported income . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The income of the vast majority of China 's rich people is unreported income , and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come ; it is a characteristic of China , an uncontrollable black hole in China 's social oversight .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
This is far from being a tax problem ; it is a deeper systemic problem .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If China 's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich , neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do ?|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It would be better to eliminate it in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
Below are some of the main reasons :|||O O O O O O O O
1. China 's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor ; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat .|||B-CARDINAL B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state 's financial revenues ; it is not to regulate the income gap .|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2004 China 's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion , accounting for about 6 % of the state 's financial revenues .|||O B-DATE B-GPE O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O
But of this 180 billion , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid by the working class .|||O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
Less than 10 % was paid by the wealthy .|||B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O
In China more than 90 % of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor .|||O B-GPE B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These poor people , who struggle just to pay for the necessities of life , their children 's education , old age , illness and death , also have to pay income tax .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all of China 's cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O
If a husband and wife have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if they pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , they have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O
A household like this can not even continue bearing basic living expenses , and their standard of living will decline .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And should anyone in the household get sick and have to go to the hospital , the family may well find itself in an economic crisis .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if a family like this wants to buy its own home , that will basically be impossible .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if only one person in a three - person family is employed , the family will have a very difficult life .|||O O O B-CARDINAL O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But even so , they have to pay 165 yuan in income tax .|||O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O
Clearly , if our income tax threshold is set at 1500 yuan , our society is destined always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope to the poor or to the masses of ever getting rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " constantly reproducing a proletariat who can only rely on selling its labor to make a living .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In short , if the personal income tax threshold is set lower than 6400 yuan , it will be ineffective in helping the poor get rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O
Conversely , if the threshold is too low , it will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability of poor people to get rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2. The personal income tax is absolutely unable to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We should not entertain any illusions that China 's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that it can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Chinese society , 20 % of the people hold 80 % of social wealth , and 80 % of the people are able to use only 20 % of the social wealth to suffer through their lives .|||O B-NORP O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O
In China , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20 % of the people .|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O
Western countries that attack China for not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; these 20 % of upper - class citizens have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When God looks at China , he sees only these 20 % ; the other 80 % he ca n't see clearly .|||O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O
The income of the vast majority of these 20 , of upper - class citizens in China is basically unreported income ; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people .|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if China wants to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of that , and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income .|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O
Anyhow , it is not something our generation will see .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China 's rich people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
It does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability of poor people to get rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A very simple explanation is that poor people are all wage earners who rely on fully declared wages for their living ; they do not have unreported income .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fully 100 % of their income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so they ca n't escape even if they wanted to .|||O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required to meet the necessary expenditures to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

With a threshold set below 5000 yuan , this generation of poor people need not think about buying a home or driving a car .|||O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Of course , many children of poor people are able to get rich , but this came about because the parents struggled harder , tightening their belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for themselves .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now how many university students who have received acceptance notifications are unable to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside have parents who are living through unimaginably hard times ?|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In Western countries , the personal income tax is the most effective means of controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But these are countries ruled by law , where official income is all recorded , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of regulating income distribution .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The situation in China is not like that ; if the personal income tax has an effect , it 's to increase financial revenues , and it has absolutely no income - regulating effect .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3. Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
The vast majority of China 's 900 million peasants are unable to reach the income level for paying income tax .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the peasants have contractual land , they have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and they have basic housing .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if people in the cities do n't have money , everything is a struggle .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If they go shopping for food by bike , they have to pay 20 cents for parking .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O
They ca n't not pay the rent or they 'll have to sleep on the street .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding just 20 % of the social wealth .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O
The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in the 20 % that goes to peasants is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have to get a reduced share of this 20 % .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O
If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for this 20 % will be reduced , which will benefit the peasants .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O
In China the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .|||O B-GPE O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4. This will really be beneficial in establishing a soft - landing market economy system .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In recent years China 's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth ; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .|||O B-DATE I-DATE B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The blood has all been pumped out of the national economy ; it 's like eating up all the seeds sown in the spring .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The proportion of financial revenues from the personal income tax is about 6 % .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O
If we cancel out this 6 % , we can slow down financial growth .|||O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O
And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .|||O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL I-CARDINAL O
And when there is too much financial investment , corruption is everywhere , all the time .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .|||B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O
Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .|||B-NORP O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no way this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
Eliminating the personal income tax to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it is better not to have this kind of personal income tax .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We need to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter , so as to benefit the country and the people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Advice to Wu Jinglian and Others : Killing the Father -- Does You No Good ! .|||O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A glance at the title , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand the core topic of this article : the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership -- because only their relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between them are there different conflicts involving " human relations , " " rules " and " science , " as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparing planned economy and public ownership to a father is tantamount to comparing market economy and private ownership to a son , which holds water principally and historically no matter you put it this way or another .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China 's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O
Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O
By sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured may be more concrete .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Regarding this , my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to , no matter how scientific its kernel is , it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , this should not provide an excuse to overthrow it by fair means or foul , as he is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O
The fact that it " finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation " is a stronger proof that it is the milestone for a new civilization resulted from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Is my opinion above correct ?|||O O O O O O
I believe you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat the above - mentioned " father " system and " son " system with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : the " father " system mentioned herein has the majority in mind or it is established in the fundamental and long - term interests of the majority , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of the country , the nation , and the overall society -- while the " son " system mentioned herein is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So , we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul without considering the consequences , because there are problems in its practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is because that will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as it violates the rule of benign social development , distorts normal " human relations " and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted in it , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , this is the case .|||O O O O O O O
My opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as demonstrated by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of the country : None of the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie " has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal , " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure the hard work -- it speaks for itself how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government it is .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT I-PERCENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That 's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father 's toes are injured , we should try our best to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And these happen to be the core of the destiny where the capitalist roaders " will inevitably bury themselves due to their ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society ! "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At last , I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu Jinglian , who insist on smearing the " father " to the end : do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization is based barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill the " father , " your felony will be disdained by the age and condemned by the people , which naturally leads to nothing good !|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I have deep feelings and a lot of sympathy with the author after reading the article Breakneck 90 m/h on a Snowy Night .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O
It also reminds me of something that I experienced several years ago , also related to an airport and meeting people .|||O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
A couple of years ago , my neighbor approached me to borrow my car , saying he was meeting his parents at the airport .|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He also said both his wife and children wanted to go .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
As his car was too small and mine was big , it could make his parents more comfortable .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He added that he would only use it for one morning and would return it to me before noon .|||O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O B-TIME O
Although there was only a nodding acquaintance between the neighbor and me , we lived in the same apartment building after all and were both Chinese .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O
So I discussed with my wife back home and lent him the car as we thought we would not be using the car until the same afternoon .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O
And then something happened ...|||O O O O O
At 1:00pm , the neighbor called me , saying he took his parents to a buffet and would probably not to be back until around 3:00pm .|||O B-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME O
I of course agreed and asked them not to rush .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
This wait lasted till 5:30pm , when the neighbor told me in a half - crying tone that there was an accident , and everyone else was intact , except his father , who was in hospital for fractures .|||O O O O B-TIME O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I comforted him first and asked my friend to rush me to the hospital .|||O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
My neighbor showed me the police report at the hospital , which indicated it was all my neighbor 's fault .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He clashed into a truck going straight when he made a left turn .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My car was completely damaged and had been towed away .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
I forced myself to refrain from the grief of loosing my beloved car -LRB- mine was liability - only coverage -RRB- and asked the friend to send their family home .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And then the nightmare began .|||O O O O O O
The next day , my neighbor called me , saying his father needed to undergo an operation in hospital and asked where the money would come from|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I told him part would be covered by my car insurance .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
After a while , he called again , saying the operation charge was high and it was difficult for them to afford|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I tried my best to comfort him then and told him to think of a way slowly|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just then , a nearly crazy voice of a woman came from the other end of the line , saying her family had just saved several dozen thousand bucks for the down payment of a house ; where would they live afterwards if they spent this .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She also said my car was a Japanese one , which had poor safety performance and it was my car to blame for the car accident .|||O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She added that I should pay the money because the car was mine .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I hung up the phone angrily as the dialog could not go on .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My wife -LSB- pw% -RSB- had been persuading me aside , saying some women would easily lose mind once in fury .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She asked me to take no heed of them and let them calm down first .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O
So I did n't take their words seriously but still felt angry .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Out of my expectation , a phone call on the third day completely changed my original idea .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O O
The telephone rang just as I was about to go to work in the morning .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought it was a sales call and was prepared to end it perfunctorily .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unexpectedly , coming from the other end of the line was a deep and resolute voice of a middle - aged man .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He said in an incontestable tone that my neighbor had a car accident as a result of borrowing my car , which traumatized them both physically and mentally and harmed their economic interests , and as the car owner , they would not sue me if I compensated them for the hospital charge and the costs of missing work hours -LRB- three times -RRB- , otherwise they would see me in court .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O
He added that he was certain about the case as a lawyer in business for ten years and the compensation he requested could double in court .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O
As a great Chinese guy , how could I be scared by a few remarks of the lawyer ?|||O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I also took up the weapon of law for justice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , I also retained a lawyer .|||O O O O O O O O O
Out of my expectation , my lawyer solved the problem by merely making two phone calls .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O
One was to the police station , asking for any additional findings in the investigation report of the accident .|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was additional findings unexpectedly , which were against them .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Someone at the junk yard found a bottle of unfinished wine without the lid inside the car and reported it to the police station .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The police found they put the bottle of unfinished wine in the car without the lid after lunch .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The second call was to their lawyer .|||O B-ORDINAL O O O O O O
So their lawyer dropped the lawsuit .|||O O O O O O O
Of course , they would not stop it there and came to discuss with me several times , sometimes honey - tongued and sometimes threatening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most classic one was : Do n't ever dream of living a life back to China , as we have people across the country .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
Disgusting !|||O O
Here comes the old topic again , are you going to lend your car if your neighbor or friend asks .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think many people will say they wo n't .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I would suggest not to lend online .|||O O O O O O O O
However , the Internet is after all virtual .|||O O O O O O O O O
Words sometimes have no emotions .|||O O O O O O
When your seemingly nice neighbor , seemingly close friend , or a girl whose eyes can speak asks for it in the real world , how many people will answer with a " no ? "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Anyhow , I was not able to do that .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I lent my car to some people in need after that , and I believe there are not many people like my former neighbor couple .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , here is a summery of the loss of the two sides : .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O

A month ago , I was really desperate , I lost my current job , which I was completely unprepared for , and had to find a job within a month to keep myself going .|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O
Now in this month with the Christmas holiday there 's really only three weeks of actual work time , and I do n't think any companies are going to be hiring people during this period .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE O O B-EVENT O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despair , that sinking feeling weighing on my mind , so much pressure I could n't eat , could n't sleep ; I was simply going crazy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I still needed to do something ; getting crazy - hysteric makes no sense .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Then I started connecting with my friends in America ; I went to Maimaiti to ask for help , consulted about my status , and looked for a way to solve the problem .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even my relatives ' friends in America and my parents ' friends all got involved .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
Friends , it 's always friends who help me at key moments .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Many friends got people they knew to recommend me , help me send out resumes , or call and commiserate with me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was one friend who had just got an offer , but he did n't want to go , so he recommended me to go for him , but it was way off in LA , plus the salary was n't ideal , but at least it could help me keep the legal status , so I thought I would take it .|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the telephone interview , I flew to LA , landing at 12:00 noon , and at 4:00 p.m. .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O B-TIME I-TIME O
I had the interview .|||O O O O O
By then 17 - 18 hours had passed since I 'd gotten up at 4:00 a.m.|||O O B-TIME I-TIME I-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME
Although I was too tired to walk , I still had to pump up my spirits so I 'd be in peak form for the interview .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The interview did n't last long , just two hours and it was over .|||O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O
I felt the interview went well , and started to feel confident .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But on that day one senior level person was n't there , so the next day early I had to go back to talk to him .|||O O B-DATE I-DATE B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
So the next day I got up at 7:00 and ran over to chat for an hour ; that guy was nice , did n't embarrass me , so after an hour it ended happily .|||O O O O O O O O B-TIME O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O
After that the boss took me to the home office , and on the way he gave me an oral offer , and he said it would not be easy for me to come right away , that I should do the physical exam immediately and do all the paperwork , wait until after New Year 's , and the HR director would return and turn in the H1 .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O O O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
Then I went straight for the physical , and I filled out the application form , reference list , etc.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At 3:00 p.m. , the dust finally settled .|||O B-TIME I-TIME O O O O O O
Finally before Christmas I received a Christmas present .|||O O B-EVENT O O O B-EVENT O O
Although I still have n't made the final decision to go , at least I have a guaranteed - minimum choice .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I am thanking everyone for helping me .|||O O O O O O O O O
I hope that all my friends who are still looking for work will be able to find their ideal job in the New Year .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-EVENT I-EVENT I-EVENT O

Guo Kai 's Economic Notes : Beijing 's Gas Price vs. US Gas Price|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O B-GPE O O O O B-GPE O O
Guo Kai 's Economic Notes|||B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON
In the US the current average price of regular unleaded gas is about 2.3 US dollars per gallon -LRB- 3.78 liters -RRB- .|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O
According to the official exchange rate of one US dollar for 7.9 RMB , this price is equivalent to 4.80 yuan / liter .|||O O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O
Note , this gas price includes all taxes .|||O O O O O O O O O
The current gas price in Beijing is 5.09 yuan / liter , 2 mao and 9 fen more than in the US .|||O O O O O B-GPE O B-MONEY I-MONEY O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O O O O B-GPE O
In fact , the gas price difference between the two places is larger than 2 mao and 9 fen because China 's gas price does not include so many taxes as in the US ; for example , the highway maintenance fee in China is paid separately .|||O O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O B-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY I-MONEY O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O
Just now , I only narrated a fact .|||O O O O O O O O O
But I believe that different persons see different problems in this fact .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Let me describe people 's two reactions that I can imagine , or the two problems I can see .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
1. The US gas price is too cheap .|||B-CARDINAL O B-GPE O O O O O O
In an absolute sense , the US gas price has +already been cheaper than China 's , and in a relative sense , the US gas price is even cheaper .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
In the US , the money you pay for a meal at McDonald 's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas , but in Beijing you can get 5 - 6 liters of gas at most .|||O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O B-GPE O O O B-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY I-QUANTITY O O O O O
The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country 's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources .|||O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there is more to this matter , the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption : global warming , and wars caused by oil , etc.|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China 's .|||O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O B-GPE O O
2. China 's gas price is too expensive .|||B-CARDINAL B-GPE O O O O O O O
Both Americans and Chinese buy gas from the international market , and the technology and cost of oil refinement are not too much different .|||O B-NORP O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China 's gas price excluding taxes , you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this .|||O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O
If there are no price controls and monopolies , China 's gas price should n't have been this high .|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O
I want to say that I think these two opinions are both correct .|||O O O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O
So , on the issue of oil consumption , I think China and the US , the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world , are also a funny pair .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O B-GPE O O O B-CARDINAL O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O
From a global perspective , the US gas price is obviously too low .|||O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O
So Mankiw at Harvard even formed a " Pigou Club , " gathering social celebrities who support levying higher taxes on gas prices -LRB- hereby raising gas prices -RRB- .|||O B-PERSON O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
China 's gas prices are more complicated .|||B-GPE O O O O O O O
In fact , gas prices in China are probably not very high , but in order to reduce China 's future overdependence on gas , it may be better that China 's gas prices are higher .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O
But , the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O O O O
This part of money will not become the government tax revenue , will not be used for public welfare , and on the contrary , will only make the benefits of those people working at the monopoly department even better .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other words , the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense .|||O O O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O
It is the price that transfers the entire social resources to a very small number of people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But in terms of sustainability , China 's gas price may still be too low .|||O O O O O O B-GPE O O O O O O O O O
We need high gas prices to control the overdependence on energy imports .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps someone will condemn me , saying further increase of gas prices will make life unbearable for people .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you are a taxi driver , my reply is : the reason your life is unbearable is not the gas price , but because of our taxi licensing regulation system .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you are a car owner , my reply is : ride the subway and bus more often .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It saves money , reduces congestion , and also lets you know car owners are not in a position to say " life is unbearable . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared with most people , your life is already quite good .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O

Almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .|||O O O O O O O O O O

Last week 's real Jackson story ran in the New York Daily News , under the snappy banner `` Creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''|||B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O B-PERSON O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The singer was brother Jermaine , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reading that Joseph was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What 's new is this :|||O O O O O O
Jermaine even suggested his father may have set up Michael to be somehow victimized by older men .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
He tells how his father would have Michael join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to Michael at those sessions .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
He said he sensed something was wrong because Michael would be sick for days after .|||O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O B-DATE O O
`` What was Joseph doing ? '' Jermaine wrote .|||O O O B-PERSON O O O B-PERSON O O
This lifts the Jackson family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and first controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All that 's missing is the element of occult terror .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Or maybe not : `` LaToya also described being awakened in the night by Joseph wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the Jackson clan had gotten with the program .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
Perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre-existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- This is how I tend to think of Ponchatoula 's Hosanna Church . -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O B-GPE O B-ORG I-ORG O O
Yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of Michael 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
His close friendship with SPECTRA contactee and channeller of the Nine , Uri Geller , for one instance .|||O O O O B-ORG O O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-CARDINAL O O
-LRB- Jackson was Geller 's best man in 2001 when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year Geller is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . -RRB-|||O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O B-DATE O O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
His entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
Even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading Jermaine 's account now .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O
Like every Jackson sibling who 's tried to break from Joe , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of Michael 's threats to sue .|||O O B-ORG O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O
Previously , Michael 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yet there they were at Jackson 's trial last year , hand in hand .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O

These were not wild birds .|||O O O O O O
The birds were bred in captivity .|||O O O O O O O
They had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by Dick Cheney and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

My experience happened when I was 15 .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O
A friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were both enamored with Kerouac & Jim Morrison & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .|||O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
He was muscle for a Pittsburgh madam named Tex Gill .|||O O O O O B-GPE O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O

So , one night , we 're at his apartment , drunk out of our minds ,|||O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
& my buddy passes out .|||O O O O O O
I continue drinking .|||O O O O
At one point , I glance at this older guy ,|||O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think , ' What the fuck ? '|||O O O O O O O O O
but I 'm pretty goddamn wasted|||O O O O O O
& reality is having a helluva time penetrating the fog in my head .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He notices that I 'm kind of staring at him .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
He stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He drops it on the couch next to me .|||O O O O O O O O O O
As he 's sitting down , he says , `` See anything you like ? ''|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....|||O O O O O O O O O O O
.... & I broke his nose with my elbow .|||O O O O O O O O O O
Make no mistake though , up till that point , the guy scared the shit out of me .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But , lucky for me , my reaction was see red anger instead of cowering fear .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After i hit him , I jumped up , ran into his kitchen & grabbed a big old butcher knife , ran back into the room & proceeded to kick my buddy into consciousness & drag his comatose ass the hell out of there .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Now , for me , the interesting part happened years later .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the time , my buddy & I were selling things .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O
My buddy had a real good supplier for these things but it was his secret .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Before I left , he had to explain to me that his supplier was none other than Freddie Feelup .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I decided to go .|||O O O O O
He was now closer to 40 & just a hollow shell of his former self .|||O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O

You will notice that Michael 's real troubles started after he suied Sony chief Tommy Mattola , who was heard to say `` he 'll live to regret the day '' .|||O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O B-ORG O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DATE O O

Here 's a description of that Michael Jackson item I was remembering :|||O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O
By the time the release of 1995 's HIStory album -- a double album of greatest hits and new tracks -- approached , Michael had fully realized a new perception of himself , one that was truly larger than life .|||O O O O O O B-DATE O B-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HIStory was hyped with a four - minute teaser video .|||B-WORK_OF_ART O O O O B-CARDINAL O B-TIME O O O
This extravagant production begins with a colossal army goose - stepping through a European city in crisp , tan uniforms , waving red flags and sporting red - and - black insignias .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Military music pounds .|||O O O O
Crowds swell at the sidelines , screaming and crying .|||O O O O O O O O O O
The implication seems to be these men represent Nazis .|||O O O O O O O O B-NORP O
But then , their leader is revealed to be Michael , marching right up front .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O
When peasant workers break free to touch Michael , they are immediately swallowed by soldiers .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
Suddenly , it is night , and a tarp - covered , skyscraper - sized structure looms over the poor nation as choppers spray spotlights across it .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brainwashed fans scream , salute with one arm and light candles with religious zeal .|||O O O O O O B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O
Signs proclaiming `` King of Pop , '' a title Michael disavowed to Oprah only two years earlier , are everywhere , emphasizing the word `` King . ''|||O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O B-PERSON O O B-PERSON O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the tarp drops , and it is , of course , a gargantuan , bronze statue of Michael , fists clenched defiantly , his star insignia prominent , yet his face still somehow child - like and unthreatening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The video is a highly disturbing piece of work .|||O O O O O O O O O O
His bloated sense of importance is not only chilling , it is threatening .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Suddenly , Michael 's perfect world of Oz / Neverland is forced to be compared with an Aryan Nation , one that substitutes children for Hitler 's master race .|||O O B-PERSON O O O O B-LOC O B-LOC O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O

regarding the JW reference .|||O O B-ORG O O
I do n't think we need see a plot in every wood pile .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

So it is only to be expected that they do not see a reason to run to and report everything to the government .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The same goes for the Roman Catholic Church .|||O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O
But the RCC has had a widespread problem with this regard , doubltlessly because their policy / doctrine of a celibate priesthood simply attracts these deviants .|||O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I doubt any such problem exist on the same proportionate scale in the JW heirarchy .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O

-LRB- If people do n't want their kids pederastized , but yet they entrust them to ' guys in gowns ' I just wonder what the hell are they thinking anyway ? -RRB-|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'd watch the Peter Pan speculations , unless you know what versions you are discussing and can differentiate between them accurately .|||O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Some of the assumptions I 've seen -LRB- such as a couple made by Tim Boucher and Fantastic Planet in last year 's postings linked here -RRB- may have looked like they worked to support their thesis , but in actuality have either a tenuous or no connection to the core Peter Pan mythos .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O

Peter Pan was a work in progress for JM Barrie , who kept tinkering with it over the years .|||B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
To understand what it actually means to Michael Jackson and what you might speculate he is enacting , you have to know where on the continuum of Peter Pans his internalized Peter -LRB- no , not THAT kind of peter -RRB- lies .|||O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O

In one of the oldest versions , Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens -LRB- extracted from The Little White Bird -RRB- , is only a week old .|||O O O O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O
He escaped from his home when he was seven days old because he remembered how he could fly when he was a bird before he was a human ,|||O O O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and that wildness is still in him , as it is with all children .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barrie 's only cryptic instructions on character development to Nina Boucicault , the first actress to play Peter , was that she was to remember that Peter is a bird , and is one day old .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE I-DATE O
In Kensington Gardens he watches out for children who have fallen un-noticed out of their perambulators .|||O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If a bad fairy finds them , or they perish from the cold an dark overnight in the park , Peter digs them graves and makes them headstones .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O
In Peter and Wendy , the Lost Boys are the ones who fall out of their perambulators when their nurse is not looking .|||O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If they are not claimed in seven days , `` they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses . ''|||O O O O O O B-DATE I-DATE O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O

Peter and the Lost Boys crave a mother to tell them stories .|||B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's ironic that while their own lives are far more exotic than the fairy tales Wendy tells , it 's those fictions that they want , told by a mother .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barrie says quite explicitly in Peter and Wendy that it is Wendy who does the tempting to keep Peter with her , not the other way around .|||B-PERSON O O O O B-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART I-WORK_OF_ART O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O
It is she who asks if Michael and John could come too .|||O O O O O O B-PERSON O B-PERSON O O O O
If those of you with the abduction theory would like to give specific quotes and information on where it is shown that Peter abducted the children , please do .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O
But I think you are making it up from a version that does n't exist in reality , or that ca n't be tied to Michael Jackson .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O
We do n't gain better understanding of the inner workings of Michael Jackson by distorting the material on which we purportedly base our theories .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON I-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O O O

About the JW thing , I work with a couple of them -LRB- BTW , some of the most respectable people I know .|||O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Which is why I decided to ask ... -RRB- ,|||O O O O O O O O O O
and I had a chance to ask them about MJ and the child abuse , if they knew anything .|||O O O O O O O O O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O O O
About MJ they said , he is definately not a JW , despite what he says .|||O B-PERSON O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O O O O O
Provocative lyrics and grabbing ones crotch in public , does n't fit with their defination of ' Christian ' .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-NORP O O
They said all they knew was that his mother -LRB- who apparently is still a member -RRB- took him to their church as a kid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The father apparently had little or no involvement at all .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
As for the child abuse , I have to agree with the post above , you can find abuse and ' sick ' individuals in ANY organization ,|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but you have too look at the proportion to the rest of society .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of my friends is an ' elder ' -LRB- soething like a ' local church leader ' -RRB- ,|||B-CARDINAL O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but he also said their instructions say that if they hear of any abuse they are to follow local laws , which usually requires them to inform the police ASAP .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And if the abuse is at all serious to report it to the police regardless .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Though i do n't agree with all of their beliefs , I know these guys well enough to call them friends .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So in their respect , after reading some of the other comments , I decided to listen to their side before passing judgement .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We should ALL be careful not to pass judgement on ENTIRE groups of people based on the apparent actions of a few .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That is what Hitler tried to do .|||O O O B-PERSON O O O O
With thiking like that , even if we got rid of the evil elite , a new set of ' evil elite ' would rise again in their place .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That seems to be the nature of man , though .|||O O O O O O O O O O O
We have all got to do what we can without needlessly attacking the innocent .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Remember , group hatred only plays into their hands , be it racial , religious , or class .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
