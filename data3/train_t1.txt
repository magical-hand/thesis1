But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O B-PER I-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O
The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .|||O O O B-ORG O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O

South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands .|||B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .|||O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .|||O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the moment this is not the case . "|||O O O O O O O O O O
He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .|||O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .|||B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .|||O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas .|||B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O
" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players .|||O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O
One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia .|||O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O
Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .|||B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O
Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .|||B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O
They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said Stich . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O

The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .|||O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O B-MISC O O B-PER I-PER O
It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .|||O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon .|||O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O B-MISC O
Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew .|||B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O
Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .|||O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O

Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again .|||O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " Medvedev said after routing Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the U.S. Open .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-MISC B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O
" I realised this year , that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis , I do n't think you can successful , " said the 22-year-old Medvedev .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O
" The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis .|||O O O O O O O O O O
I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For Medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand .|||O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" I know what I 'm here for , " said Medvedev , who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago .|||O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O
" It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " Medvedev said of his current ranking of 36 . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O
It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As part of his new businesslike approach , Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off .|||O O O O O O O O B-PER O B-MISC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While Medvedev 's 77-minute romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable .|||O B-PER O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the original draw , Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other .|||O O O O O B-PER O B-PER O O O O O O O

The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .|||O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters .|||O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O B-PER I-PER O B-ORG O
But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 14 EU partners .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O B-ORG O O
" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O
I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , " Kiely said .|||O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O B-PER O O
" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .|||O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins .|||B-LOC I-LOC O B-PER O O O B-PER O O
Donna Sells|||B-PER I-PER
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O B-ORG O O O B-PER O O O
Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .|||O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. " Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . "|||O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O
Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .|||O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O
As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury .|||O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-ORG O
Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .|||O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O
" And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as Rubin ) , if not stronger , " Perelstein said . "|||O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O
